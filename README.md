# F&B_skyhack_peace911

The project contains F&B services analysis for United Airlines. Majorly two different analysis has been conducted:

1. Finding the key drivers of F&B satisfaction rate for the month of September ( summer month, as only September data was available.)

2. Finding the major themes of complaints from the comments from the passengers and highlighting the areas where improvement can increase satisfaction rate.

Apart from these two objects, the project also involves:
1. Top 10 flights, origin and destination of flight on the basis of in-flight satisfaction rate.
2. In-flight satisfaction rate has been calculated for all the groups of every column analysed.
3. Some extra deep dives for increasing the satisfaction rate.
