0,There was no salad dressing. The staff informed me that the flight did not receive any salad dressing for any of the meals.
1,Not a choice.
2,More variety and bigger snacks.
3,"Serving pretzels and cookies in first class was extremely disappointing. Really, a little thought from chef would go a long way."
4,More inflight selections to purchase for full meals.
5,Hot food options would be nice.
6,"Ok, better than most United flights I have been on."
7,"I enjoy illy coffee, but the decaf instant was not all pleasant. Do not recommend using that brand for decaf."
8,I had a seltzer.
9,I thought a 3rd entree should be offered. no real dessert (a cookie) and vodka was a poor choice brand.
10,Beef was too tough to cut or chew.
11,no.
12,Chicken sattar was dry and bland.
13,Grateful United has lemons for tea and coke. No other airline does!.
14,Out of apple juice.
15,I would have preferred bottled water. Not a big deal as it was a red eye flight.
16,Having some fresh fruit options (just like apples or oranges or something) would be very nice. It is hard to get fresh fruits and veggies at the airport. Also having a small salad with the meal would be recommended over a noodle starter. Thank you!.
17,Need kosher creamer.
18,The chicken entree was a thai chicken noodle. The problem is thai food tends to contain peanuts and neither of the stewardesses knew if this entree contained peanuts which is important because my son has a peanut allergy.
19,"Would like to see a more meal selection, better snacks. like nuts/fruit etc."
20,The travelers should be given 2 snacks instead of 1.
21,"I and my wife did not partake in the complimentary meal that was served. However, we did not receive anything else until we asked for a few snacks. Attendent needed to be more attentive to this."
22,Short flight offered a cup of water which was nice.
23,white wine had gone bad;. make sure they cork the bottles or empty them out between flights.
24,Not many it any gluten intolerant options. So much bread and cookies that I could not eat.
25,Please improve the coffe.
26,"In the pre-order menu the burger, breakfast sandwich, and oatmeal were not offered. Would have preferred one of those to getting the snack box. Would like to purchase a second alcoholic beverage."
27,No.
28,That was by far the best food I have ever had on a flight!. I have flown to Africa and back many times and never had a meal as delicious as that!.
29,Breakfast was good as well.
30,I wish there was a wider selection of snacks to buy on the plane.
31,Quality of the meal was fair at best.
32,"Unusually the in flight food was quite satisfying and tasty, could have been a little bigger…especially the ice cream given as dessert. But on a whole very good all round."
33,The burger for the lunch meal did not taste that great. Especially for a first class meal a heated up burger was lacking compared to ticket price. The only other feedback is the amount of times someone came with the beverage cart compared to other airlines. Other airlines it was more frequent.
34,Food quality probably was not up to par with Polaris cabin.
35,Please provide more range of vegetarian food.
36,"on our return flight we were asked to choose either a cookie or pretzels, on our outbound flight we were given both, it should have been consistent."
37,"on the other flight, I appreciated the Illy coffee."
38,It is a really short flight. they did not even offer us water.
39,Flight ran out of cookies and being towards the back of the plane I had to opt for pretzels.
40,Very impressed with the quality and quantity.
41,We never got any food or beverages.
42,no.
43,no.
44,No.
45,I would like a bottle of water.
46,no.
47,I was charged me so much for a short trip. the options for beverage were Coke or water. How cheap this company has became!.
48,No.
49,Please add a diet caffeine free soda such as Sprite Zero or diet ginger ale. We had breakfast as we were in business. The breakfast was great!.
50,No.
51,Why do not you offer any free snacks?.
52,Coffee was served very hot…a nice surprise.
53,I think In long 16 hour flight the vegetarian menu should be more elaborate.
54,No.
55,Staff very attentive.
56,Bring back the Continental Ice Cream service please!!!!!.
57,The flight attendant was hard working and friendly!.
58,nothing more.
59,The food was too spicy.
60,Offering a whole piece of fruit would have been nice.
61,should give out bottles of water vs cups on a long flight.
62,All complimentary items must be given to everyone without asking the passengers.
63,Great.
64,Could use a bit of freshening up the food selection in First Class.
65,"Loved the flavored Aha sparkling water. Thank you!. Since you took peanuts away, a gluten free pretzel or option would be amazing."
66,"Tje Brioche cheeseburger is really good, but ketchup and mustard should also be provided."
67,There we are nö snacks Like Chips/pretzels.
68,"We were fine in business our kids that had flown you business over with us and we could only get premium economy back could get even a glass of water and not one meal of choice that was selected was received and yet they watched the meal they had choice, be handed out all through economy. So they paid more for less service."
69,Nothing else because I am ok with water.
70,I would like to have a change in the menu if possible. I have had the chicken and meatballs many times now.
71,your snacks only cater to the general public. How about have at least one item cater to customer with diabetes.
72,I had my own water because I do not like the taste of Dasiana. The size portion is really so small for the price of our tickets.
73,A wine list for business class is somewhat expected. We did not get that on this flight.
74,Coffee was good.
75,The meals aim to be creative but I prefer more traditional meals.
76,Better Scotch selection.
77,At least this flight provided pretzels. The one to Louisville did not offer anything but a drink.
78,Very tasty. Nice portion.
79,It pleases me tremendously that United has added sparkling wine to its beverage list.
80,"It was the only time I saw a flight attendant, that is good."
81,No.
82,Please provide healthier snack options - sugar and gluten free on the airplane and in the club.
83,The only beers available were Ultra Lite and Stella Artois. There should be at least one more option.
84,The arrival snack which was a cheeseburger was a little dry and tough. Main course meal was good.
85,"I just wish I could you le get more yummy desserts!. I wanted the ice cream. I am vegetarian, not vegan. And the sandwich for the second meal was very boring: bread, cucumber and tomato. No taste at all <😊>."
86,Need to change the menu. The food was not to appetizing.
87,Breakfast was very small.
88,No.
89,More options.
90,first class and there are no snack boxes available ?. Come on!. Give us a box please.
91,"Loved my gluten-free meal option, but there are no gluten free snacks available. Miss having a gluten-free nut option. ( husband ate my Biscoff)."
92,No.
93,No.
94,I would just like to be reimbursed for the extra expense of buying new connecting tickets on to Sardinia.
95,Pleasantly surprised by the quality and diversity of choices.
96,You need some non indian options also. Not everyone wants indian food especially when you are headed there for a two week business trip and all you will be eating is indian food. Please give us some other options for dinner and breakfast.
97,"Had pre ordered drinks. Attendant had no record of pre order. When I inquired about white wine, only choice was Chardonnay. Then requested vodka. Vodka brand served was not the best. My husband's Jack Daniels was what he had requested so that was fine."
98,Water bottles are too small. a larger size could be offered.
99,Snack was better than the dinner.
100,There was so much turbulence. no drinks were offered.
101,Please provide light snack.
102,None.
103,Dinner not that tasty... breakfast should have a savory bread option or similar.
104,None.
105,would like ice and lemonade.
106,I would have expected a 2nd service of beverages given the duration of the flight.
107,"You only have one sugar free soda, and that with caffeine. I think you could do better. How about one sugar free caffeine free offering?. All snacks loaded with sugar. How about some pretzels or something not so loaded with sugar?."
108,I think it is excellent that you continue to provide Biscoff cookies and Stroopwafels. Truly an experience of decadence in an otherwise humdrum world.
109,Beverage selection was ok.
110,"It would be nice if you offered other diet options other than just Diet Coke, like Diet 7Up or Sprite. The quality of food in Business class has always been lacking. I had connected from a flight from Europe on Turkish Airlines. the quality of food was like comparing a 5 star restaurant to McDonalds. No matter what the comments, I highly doubt that United will get on par with the best airlines in the food quality in Business Class as I have heard the same thing from other travelers for many years. United obviously does not consider this to be a priority, whereas they absolutely should."
111,N/A.
112,no.
113,While the food was hot the menu leaves something to be desired. Quinoa is an ingredient that could be replaced with Oreo.
114,The Pinot noir was kind of a fruit bomb of a wine. Did not have more than a couple sips.
115,No.
116,There really was no food or beverage offered in 1st class on this flight—only a glass of water.
117,Portions too small and pret.
118,Too short for service.
119,"When getting a soft drink, the flight attendant should always offer the whole can."
120,"It would be good to allow more preorder of the meal items. I tried to preorder shortly after I received the notification, but all of the food items were already sold out. Thus, I ended up preordering a Tapas snack box, which I then swapped to the burger on board when they had inventory."
121,On my first flight segment from Milan to Newark I pre-selected a vegan meal. They provided me a curry dish with Chicken in it and a salad with some white creamy dressing. Clearly NOT a vegan meal.
122,No.
123,"When we first took off the flight attendants told us there were no snacks, the previous employees had failed to refill, but then later on they gave us a choice between strop waffles and pretzels so I think they found some somewhere. I felt bad for the flight attendants for having to deal with that. They were great though!."
124,No snack.
125,I wanted to comment on the United Club food - eggs and bacon ar very good addition.
126,"Great offer!. Meal, snack, water, and so on."
127,None.
128,Thank you for carrying Buffalo Trace!. It is the best bourbon that you can not find in stores around the US.
129,Oatmeal breakfast had a good mix of items.
130,There was no choice in snacks only pretzels given on both flights. Pretzels are too dry and tasteless.
131,Why can not bottles be used instead of cans?. I am on a flight with turbulence with a cup full of water and ice. Makes no sense.
132,no.
133,"Not offered water, drink or anything before take off. Had to go to section behind to ask for water to take some medicine."
134,Change up the snacks sometimes.
135,Food quality was better before pandemic.
136,My connecting flight from Des Moines was on time. everything in O'Hare was closing. there was no food available. It would have been nice to have offered the snack boxes for sale but that was not an option for an 8pm flight. Did not arrive in IAD until midnight and of course everything was closed outside the airport.
137,Such a small amount but I get it [amount] you do not want anyone getting drunk on the plane.
138,"No, this flight was very good. Wish we could have preordered our meal and had more beverages but the attendants were too busy making meals."
139,Meal was not hot or as good wuality of items as the flight from Dublin to Newark. Much better quality on.
140,They are to expensive. $10. For Baileys?.
141,"The ability to purchase other snacks was not briefed (or I missed it if it was). Given that passengers are told to have an active credit card in their so that onboard snacks can be purchased, this seems odd."
142,Why would you serve a barley salad when the chicken came with rice?. Too many grains.
143,I wondered why we were not given pretzels/nuts on this flight??.
144,I encourage the airline to have a greater variety of higher-end and higher quality food options. United is lacking is this area relative to other major international airlines.
145,"I was surprised that on one of our United flights they provided milk for my son. I was thrilled because that is just about all he will drink and it made my experience much better that there was milk onboard. I also loved being served champagne before we took off, and feel paying for First Class was totally worth it just for that!."
146,Would have like to been offered a comp snack like pretzels.
147,Pretty small portions.
148,No.
149,we were not offer any food or snacks.
150,No thank you.
151,Pretzels tasted a little stale.
152,The fruit in the fruitbowl part of the meal was surprisingly good.
153,Obviously selections have gone downhill.
154,"I think w such long flights, one round of beverages are hurried than never offered again."
155,Should give second chance for beverage.
156,With 4 hours mid day we could have used something a bit more substantial.
157,"It was a shame not to have some sort of hot food on the flight. On the outbound there was, but not on the return flight."
158,Na.
159,Some more options would be nice.
160,The unique options made the flight very pleasant.
161,Now you have to have the app with a credit card saved. No cash or credit card used. Better selection of food would be nice. the price is a little high.
162,"I got the message prior to boarding to save a credit card for food purchases, which I did. However, many other passengers on the flight were not prepared and were complaining about this. I do not think this is the way to go, as it is way too inconvenient for passengers. I recommend bringing back the option to pay with a credit card onboard the aircraft."
163,"Bring back the old ""Continental"" warm cookie and coffee for dessert. Same for the ice cream sundae treats the old ""Continental"" overseas flights offered. The nearly freeze dried ice cream and brownie wafer topping was a big let down on my Houston-Munich and Frankfurt-DC legs... Beverage selection was very good though."
164,No.
165,Chicken risotto dish was awful.
166,They do not need to give a whole can.
167,no.
168,Amount of food was decreased when compared with flight 4 years ago (my last trip to the United States).
169,Make sure the plane is stocked with cookies before each flight lol.
170,not much.
171,Hot meals could be better.
172,No food.
173,"Everything has cheese, which is bad for lactose intolerant people or vegans."
174,Biscoff cookies were not available.
175,The meal was excellent.
176,I would like to recieve snacks and coke. Not just water and a cookie.
177,The waffles were overly sweet. Could not eat them. My husband's eggs were quite salty.
178,Pretzels have always had a stale taste - find a new company.
179,"Good was second class, tasteless not for the thousands I paid for first class."
180,The Spanish Tempranillo was very good.
181,Excellent flight staff.
182,More choices would be nice.
183,Would be nice if there was something other than the snack boxes.
184,Nice variety.
185,It ani't the way it [way] used to be.
186,Like that I received the entire can of juice.
187,No.
188,As I said above could not order snacks for my friends.
189,More variety on the snacks.
190,It would be nice to have an entire can of soda or bottle of water to ourselves.
191,They do not have the pre-order now that I reserved option. I was happy with the option.
192,Loved the biscotti!.
193,No.
194,yes a beer.
195,No offer of additional food despite being a First Class passenger. Tried to pre-order gluten-free meal for wife and it kept kicking me out of the app.
196,"I am thankful that on this flight there was the choice of something that did not have sugar. Even though pretzels is a carb and it could spike the sugar, so I am thankful the airport stores sell nuts airlines before used to offer a small package of knots. I know everyone's Hass to watch the cost but yes the snacks right on the smaller side, thankful for the efficiency and friendliness of the attendance and the efficiency of the plane, mechanics and pilots. Super job!."
197,No.
198,Shortage of snack box options.
199,Simple and good.
200,Offer soft alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine at no charge.
201,Great improvement from previous flights with business class.
202,You could offer at least more cookies.
203,I would love to have a Dr Pepper served on United flights!. Southwest Airlines provides Dr Pepper. Why does not United?.
204,No service in Busineess class before the flight. Some flight you get device before take off. Inconsistent. Drink service seemed late and did not come back to ask for a refill. Weather was good and no turbulence.
205,"Please be more descriptive with the food and stop trying to be so healthy or at least have options. The whole grain buns were gross. The mushy risotto whatever was gross. The spinach throughout, gross. The chicken had good spice, cooked well for a microwave, and plated nicely. Tomato sauce was nice. But the rest was just gross and inedible. With a real bread roll or toast and some actual normal pasta that would be a delicious meal. Similar to some that Lufthansa serve. This was too healthy to be edible."
206,More choices.
207,Coffee was hot <😊>.
208,"In the past, there was a separate serving of warm fresh croissants, cinnamon rolls. now you get one dried out croissant with your breakfast meal."
209,Too short of a flight for service. That is fine.
210,would still like to pay during flight... I am not going to order food/snacks under current pay system.
211,Turbulence kept the service from happening.
212,The selection was good. the quality was poor and gross to drink. Both the purchased sparkling wine and complimentary sparkling water.
213,There should be a light meal served.
214,Extraordinary flight attendants.
215,I had not received the option to preorder in the past. Great feature - makes for a satisfying in flight meal experience.
216,"I like it when I get the whole can, not just a pour...some flights yes some no."
217,None.
218,I thought maybe a sherbet would have been a bit better.
219,No.
220,Loved the champagne welcome as we were getting seated.
221,There were not any. we got in early so I do not really care.
222,Please give bottle so that I may mix my own drink.
223,Food was so tasty and seasoned so well!. Dessert option was not the best. It was ice cream. I am lactose intolérant. No to the Dasani water.
224,The food and beverages were ok.
225,Tasty snacks.
226,"I pre ordered my breakfast but then was informed my selection was not available. Nor was the second alternative available. The last alternative was something I did not want. No fault of the flight attendant, but why give passengers the option to pre order when what they select is not available?."
227,The selection and availability needs improvement.
228,A 1st Class seat should have better food or snack options.
229,The chicken dinner was surprisingly tasty. We ate all of it.
230,"The selection was good. It is a business class meal, maybe bring back a proper appetizer, bread basket, etc. The salad offered with the meal was very unappetizing. It had a dressing in the bottom of the bowl with the salad on top. Probably the worst attempt at a salad on a plane I have had."
231,I realize it is a short flight but would prefer higher quality snack options for sale.
232,Only one drink service on a 4 hour flight seemed paltry.
233,Not much I can say about complimentary snacks. They are pretty chinsey.
234,I like that I was offered the can instead of just the small cup for my beverage.
235,"Pretty ordinary selection of food..... I think we can do better..... Cheese cracker, snickers, M&Ms, beef jerky, pop corn etc......"
236,No.
237,no cookies or pretzels anymore with flight time \< 90 minutes?. I used to enjoy a stroopwaffel between DFW & IAH. Sad for this development.
238,None setved.
239,Cups were filled halfway with lots of ice.
240,A little bag of something on the Chicago to Atlanta portion of the trip would have been nice.
241,I am 82. I remember the days of nice snacks and meals.
242,I did not hear. missed the part where I could have ordered a snack in advance. So consequently I only had the onboard snack to choose from. the pretzels tasted stale to me.
243,I appreciated having the choice of ice or not and of a cup or can.
244,I was in Premium Economy and I did not think they had a limitation on wine?.
245,Food offering in First class not up to par w other competitors.
246,No pre dinner drinks were offered.
247,Thank You.
248,"I was disappointed that the menu for the flight was a photocopy on copier paper, manually cut in half, and included no list of the wines being offered on the flight. Menus should be printed on durable cardstock."
249,"My outbound flight from SFO to BOS on 9/27/22 I purchased a breakfast sandwhich. I tried to retrieve my receipt using an email link I received, without luck, using my name and credit card info and my name and reservation number. I elected not to purchase anything on the BOS to SFO flight home."
250,"My first class flight out bound had just a snack and coffee, return first class had cheese platter."
251,No.
252,The taste was strong very condimented.
253,No.
254,"Beverage serving could be more often, eg. before and after lunch/dinner."
255,"Like I mentioned before, the food from Paris to Chicago was good. It was the flight from Chicago to Amsterdam where the food was just awful and very disappointing. Could not even identify what it was."
256,Did not purchase food as the options were meager and not very appealing.
257,No.
258,"There is a requirement to have a smart phone with an app, which seems to be waived if you do not have the tech, as we did not. We think we should be ablee to simply use our credit card as before."
259,It said there is meal on the first class ticket. In the end just drink.
260,Offer free domestic beers on the premium service flight.
261,"Too little choice, Burger was greasy."
262,Sitting in first row. you should not already be out of the choices I am presented.
263,Change it up more frequently. Gets boring and unappealing.
264,We had pretzels for a snack and they were stale.
265,"Loved that you gave a full can of soda. Did not love that there were no peanuts, but that is probably an allergy thing."
266,"If you could, it would be great to advise passengers when they book if they need to order a meal ahead of time. At time of on line check in, it may be too late."
267,"Stale bread , like cardboard . Chicken and mashed potatoes had wierd flavor and/or after taste . Like chemical . Have noticed this on other chicken / potato meals."
268,Would like to see a more consistent snack. Pretzels sometimes does not make thru the whole flight.
269,No.
270,The food choices are all unappetizing.
271,Chicken entrée was very similar to starter with quinoa etc. which is not to my taste. As a result just picked out the chicken.
272,never was perfect.
273,no snacks.
274,The lunch meal was not great.
275,No salad with meal (although salad dressing was brought). No nuts as appetizer offered.
276,"Out of a few flavors, limited selection."
277,Need more GF and Vegan options on all flights.
278,Stop giving snacks give substantial snacks Do not wastecfood.
279,So good!.
280,It would be nice to have alternatives to lager. I have occasionally had IPA on a flight but that it very rare.
281,"Yes, at no time before the flight could I make a food selection due to the short window of opportunity, I tried several times."
282,Excellent choices available.
283,the vegetarian noodles were not good. there was no chicken left.
284,"Was very happy the flight attendant saved my meal until later so I could sleep. The flight left at 11:30 pm. I wanted to sleep. eat the meal later, which the flight attendant took care of in a very helpful way."
285,Good service from flight attendents.
286,No.
287,I flew first class and was pleased with my food and beverage selection.
288,No.
289,Please offer a snack with the beverage-early morning flight-a small snack would be appreciated.
290,Nothing.
291,Please offer sugar free organic options. I do really appreciate the sparkling water choices.
292,No.
293,No.
294,Water tasted bad.
295,"Only 2 meal options available - same as a recent flight. One was no longer available on board. Flight attendant was responsive and offered snack box along with other meal offerings (fruit, cookie) to accommodate."
296,Nothing I can think of.
297,You used to give a snack cookie out. on the last several flights I have been on they are no longer offered.
298,"It is was good…. Not great. But ok, nothing to complain about."
299,No.
300,Nothing.
301,What was the purpose of pre-order when the attendants knew nothing about it.
302,No food or beverage on 47 minute flight.
303,"No snacks, pretzels."
304,Only one choice going. Coming back they had a vegan meal as a choice.
305,"Need higher quality in first, and also increased food service. Offer snacks more often. There is one meals served, then nothing for several hours, then 1 offer of a snack."
306,"Coast-to-coast flight, should offer a little more food. But, OK."
307,"The dinner was a choice between curry vegetables and chicken. I dislike Indian food so my choice was chicken. The chicken pieces were good, but this sort of quinoa-kind-of-thing is that kind of ""new age"" foods (kale, gluten free, all cardboard-tasty-good-for-you new stuff) that I also dislike. The salad that was a side dish was a lemony-sweety-crunchy mix that I did not like either. Fortunately, I had an ultraenemy-bad-wolf tasty sandwich that I had bought before boarding that made me feel comfortable on my 9hr and some more minutes trip from Houston to Buenos Aires. I have to say that I am an oldy 65. I am used to eat real food. Yours sincerely, The Dinosaur."
308,No.
309,"My only substantive disappointment on the food and beveridge offering (business class) was the total lack of description (none!). on menus of wine offerings. Food was quite good, as were wines. Flight attendants served huge sizes of wines. not optimal if one wanted to taste several."
310,Miss bread service.
311,no.
312,.
313,The warm meals are not good.
314,Having a seperate in flight menu vs putting it into the magazine and having to hunt for it.
315,Vegetarian entree for dinner was odd.. a cold noodle concoction which I did not like and a salad over a flaky bread disc…I was expecting something hot and tasty.
316,Would like to see options for less sugary drinks/juice and snack varieties.
317,"I can not eat gluten and can not have dairy, but had to select one or the other in order to place an order. It would be great to have foods that meet several criteria;. for example, something can be gluten-free and also vegan, and that way people who have multiple restrictions can easily make a choice that will result in foods they are able to eat."
318,Biscoffs are very good...would have loved to see a portion of 4.
319,"nice selection of beverages, specifically the choices of waters."
320,"Just a thank you for my upgrade - my chicken, orzo and kale dish was excellent, a delicious small blueberry dessert. Certainly helped me arrive in Spokane very happy!."
321,I would love it if you offered Dr. Pepper (or Mr. Pibb or similar) as an option! <:)>.
322,Good.
323,Quality can be improved.
324,The food served in First class was fabulous. Loved it!.
325,Need to give more options for food that is free.
326,No.
327,"Should have options for low carb and other diet. It was not an option for me to choose when I booked the ticket. If there were an option, I might miss it because it was not clearly listed on the screen when I booked the ticket."
328,Food and beverage for purchase required payment through the United app. I do not like storing credit card information online. Why not ApplePay or other contactless payments?.
329,It was a short flight so did not expect much.
330,No.
331,Would like to have a root beer as part of the beverages.
332,"I was interested in purchasing additional food and an alcoholic beverage, but did not have the United app on my phone, so did not have a contactless way of paying. I was discouraged, as a result, from making a purchase."
333,Bring back the sundae service.
334,What happen to the hot meals flights gave out.
335,na.
336,Yes.
337,"When a flight is nearly 5 hours long, a free that is more substantial than pretzels or biscoff should be offered."
338,Everything was great thank you so much your staff was great greatly appreciated thank you so much.
339,I had just water.
340,The entree was very dissatisfying regarding flavor and texture.
341,The snack between the two main meals was not satisfactory.
342,"I would like to see recycling performed by the crew - everything went in the trash on my Denver to EWR flight. All cans, glasses, & papers went in the trash. no recycling services was offered. When I asked a crew member about recyclsing, she said the recycle bags were in the back and could not be accessed. So I took all my recyclables with me when disembarking the plane, and recycled them inside the EWR airport - but everybody else's stuff was thrown away..."
343,"It was fine. For Gold status, with i did not have to pay for a snack (hummus box)."
344,None.
345,I did not receive the burger I preordered had choice is chicken or meatless meatballs. Selected chicken and did not enjoy it. Chicken was rubbery.
346,More options…. Especially for first class.
347,A snack used to also be provided. On the last few flights there was no snack.
348,"For the snack before landing, I asked for a Coke Zero but was told they were out. I was sitting in the second row of Economy Plus and am a 1K member, so I am somewhat shocked that a flight of this length would not have Coke Zero available."
349,No.
350,New Polaris menu is excellent.
351,Food can have more vegetarian options.
352,Ran out of cookies.
353,"Could be a bit more variety. Not for the main course but for the snack prior to landing (only a cold sandwich with cheese was served). Besides that, everything was great based on economy class standards."
354,"The white wine felt like very low quality and had a bad taste. I did not drink it. The quality of the food was mostly ok, but not great. I would have loved to receive a healthier meal."
355,"Pour or leave the whole can!. After adding ice to the cup, I think I got 2 swallows of water."
356,"For a 2 hour flight, why serve anything?. Just seems weird and a waste."
357,"Wine and beer should not be charged at Economy Plus and for such long flight, the snacks needs to be improved."
358,"I did not have my phone set up with a credit card so I could not order anything. Understand rational, but I would have liked to order, but I was not interested in entering my credit card on an unsecured network."
359,Bigger snack bags also non-gluten.
360,Digestifs.
361,Loved that you had stroopwafels!.
362,Had coffee and a cookie And may I said a small cookie!!!!. It would be nice to get back to FOOD.
363,It is ok.
364,Larger bag of pretzels!.
365,No.
366,I liked that there was a vegetarian option as part of the regular food offering. I did not have to request a special meal. One main meal and two snacks were just right for the the 10+ hour flight.
367,no.
368,"Lots of wasted food since no choice of items was given, just all of it served."
369,"Go back to the days where we all had a modest ""snackbox"" and hot food in 1rst."
370,The snack options are rather limited. At least the Biscoff cookies are tasty though.
371,I would like more options for purchase.
372,Wine was cheap. I recommend United to offer better quality wines.
373,On line it was stated that my flight would serve a meal.
374,The frequency in which I was able to get a water or beverage refill seemed a little below the normal frequency I have experienced on previous United flight.
375,No free food offered. Loved the sparking water options thank you!.
376,The snack I received was dry and not pleasant.
377,No.
378,Healthier choices.
379,No.
380,Flight attendants gave you the whole can!. It speeds up service so much. you get more than three sips - genius. Great policy.
381,The club lounge food options were not very good. No toaster for bagels.
382,Serve the whole can of juice.
383,No.
384,Was much improved since the last time I flew in 2019!.
385,Macadamia nuts.
386,No.
387,"Wonderful chicken dinner Wellington burger, not so much."
388,Cold wheat berry salad has been on the menu for a number of years and it is inedible and most of the passengers Avoid eating it.
389,The green tea is not strong enough.
390,They should give you a whole can instead of a half of can.
391,Options of wine should be considered.
392,"For a 9 hour flight I find it unsatisfactory to only be offered 1 meal, towards the beginning, then with 7 hours of pay only options."
393,No.
394,No.
395,"Food choices were awful. And I had to find flight attendant to request a cocktail. Hot towels should have been offered right away. I flew Austrian Airlines Premium Plus. we were greeted with a hot towel, a cocktail and warm nuts. And a printed menu. United's premium plus was only worth it for the seat."
396,Love Buffalo Trace...
397,Beef salami has consistently been one of the worst salamis. The box also changed and no longer includes two cheese spreads but a sickeningly sweet fig spread. The breadsticks are a good change.
398,Vegan milk would be nice.
399,None served. Short flight.
400,All great.
401,No thank you.
402,"Really a 2oz pack of pretzels or a cookie, need more choices and larger serving."
403,Should offer 2 snacks for 6 hour flight and better selection would be nice.(like JetBlue).
404,More hot options please!. And please bring back the waffles regardless of time of day.
405,"We desperately need more choices for entrees, it is always just za'tar chicken or impossible meatballs. aside from that, the food was good - fruit bowl was very fresh and pie in the sky is DELICIOUS never get rid of it!!!!."
406,Pre departure beverage in First Class was water or OJ. Missed the champagne choice.
407,NA.
408,Better than expected.
409,Give passengers more than one snack. They are small and it is frustrating to go through all the j Sue's with flying United and then be told you can not have both the snacks offered. Ridiculous.
410,Better snack boxes please!.
411,No - not much need for a one-hour flight.
412,Love the new chateau sovereign pinot. The cookie with the chocolate center was really good. I think the zatar chicken was actually harissa chicken.
413,"PIlot said no bathroom or service die to predicted turbulence. May I suggest that they distribute SMALL water bottles before takeoff, l for hydration and folks can keep them safe and put lid on if bumpy. Can also give folks a little snack even with turbulence. will not jump out of hand. May actually calm folks who are not used to our flights over the mtns. THere were barely any turbulents, by the way."
414,I asked for chicken and was given pasta. The pasta was adequate. I would have preferred chicken.
415,Food was very tasty.
416,More options on food in first/business.
417,I would rather have a chilled bottle or can. I have hear how dirty the ice and coffee are.
418,Food quality has really improved vs prior to the pandemic disruption.
419,No.
420,"The salad was dour, tasteless and not appetizing. For business class I would expected something a little better."
421,Would like to see bistro onboard offered on late night flights.
422,"I think you should give water in a bottle, not in a glass, even if they are small."
423,Good.
424,I prefer decaf sugar free soft drinks.
425,No food offered.
426,No.
427,"Tea and coffee would have been good, sadly none."
428,A four hour flight it would be nice if there were a more substantial snack.
429,In business would have preferred to have available wines printed in the menu. Felt like economy service with business price.
430,More choises first class.
431,No.
432,They did not have Coke Zero.
433,I wish there had been some snacks available especially since we sat on the tarmac ove an hour.
434,Better selection of food.
435,I thought it strange that juice & water were served in paper cups & not bottled I suppose to expedite.
436,Herbal tea options would be appreciated.
437,food was not good.
438,No.
439,Better options for snack for breakfast and lunch actually breakfast sandwich and lunch sandwich. More choices for beverage e special scotch.
440,"The salad shaker was great. Good concept. Them popcorn was good too. But the red stick and pretzels <🥨> were ok, not great. They only had one of the three We flew from COS TO Denver, really close on connecting flight. Then Denver to Newark, I flight so close on time from gate to gate. I paid a fee to board early on the flight from Denver to Bergen, $112. That was a joke. I was lucky to board at all. We almost missed the flight. We got on board and we very happy with the Economy plus seats , I stand 6’ 8” so any extra space is great. I would like to be refunded for the extra boarding fee of $ possible snack boxes. A little pricy. The filgts were so close together we had no time in the concourse to buy anything."
441,"food was served hot, but was vegetarian instead of beef."
442,"Option of scotch are not many, only one which is not great."
443,"I would like premium margaritas as an option. And, premium champagne like Laurent Perrier or Nicolas Feuillatte. Additionally, it would be nice to have easier access to see the available alcoholic drinks on these international flights in Polaris business class!. Why is it a secret?."
444,No.
445,A cookie or a small snack on a two plus hour flight would have been nice.
446,"Would have been nice to have the option for a water refill, especially since the water bottle refill station outside the gate in Dulles was out of order and we were destined for a high altitude, dry climate location."
447,You have to diwnload the app and maje sure the credit card is linked to the app. that is tge downside for me since there is no wifi.
448,Beverages not offered.
449,Unos tacos.
450,No snacks on a 2 he flight. No consistency on service vs flights.
451,I thought we were given too much food. Would have preferred to sleep instead of eating. The snack/breakfast was not needed.
452,"Scrambled eggs we ordered became undercooked omelet, served half hour after row in front of us."
453,pasta entree ran out before my row. there were only 2 beer options.
454,Menu has not changed in a long time. More variety would be nice.
455,I would love if green tea was offered on future flights!.
456,nope!.
457,I had to get up to request beverage refill.
458,Not really.
459,Water was cold.
460,None.
461,I was not offered any snack on my leg from Las Vegas to Denver.
462,Pretzels would have been nice.
463,I was glad to receive the entire can of soda with my cup of ice.
464,Why was there not even a snack ??. No free snack??.
465,Chicken with harissa was not good.
466,"Would have preferred a lighter meal for lunch on this flight, such as a sandwich option (instead of the two entrees offered)."
467,One used to be offered a cocktail followed by a drink with dinner. The drink with dinner is no longer offered - which is quite a step down. I did ask and was given a little bottle which was very nice. I thought they may have given it to me as I had changed my seat.... but it was not generally on offer. Most people want to sleep on that flight so it is particularly noticeable not to be offered a second glass.
468,No.
469,We flew Vancouver-Chicago-Ft. Lauderdale and then the reverse home. All 4 flights had the same 2 entrees. It would have been nice to have different options on the return flight a week later.
470,Perfect.
471,N/A - more of a variety.
472,When I fly I am always conscious of my food allergy. I have a dairy allergy. I can mostly pick my way around a menu. I always feel like I am living on the edge. Given the large number of people that have allergies or intolerances to dairy I am wondering if that could be taken into consideration when preparing menus. This could make inflight lavatory use a little easier. Also consider gluten. I can only imagine the work that goes into creating a menu. So please see this as a concerned traveling humbly making a suggestion which I am sure you have probably already got in hand.
473,"I tried to pre-order alcoholic drinks and snack box but the app said that you were out of stock on all drinks, which I thought was strange. I did get the snack box."
474,It is fine. The snack packs are a rip off.
475,No.
476,"We had tried to sign in for food. our card information did not go through. We went from Portland Maine to Pasco with the cookies, it was a bet much for late 70 youngsters!. We should have tried to buy food ahead."
477,The pre select meal option did not work. In your app or on your website. I tried numerous times once I received notice it was time to pre order.
478,Was not offered a drink during the lunch service on flight.
479,The Bagel sandwich is absolutely the BEST breakfast sandwich I have ever eaten... EVER!. You should make them available all day long...they def would sell!. Reason to book early flights!.
480,Food was average the yogurt was plain and tasteless. the orange muffin was awfully sweet.
481,The chicken was ok. everything was overdone or mushy.
482,It used to be so much better . Salad did not have dressing ( none available ) ice cream sundae . Nope not really . United should be embarrassed by the business class food in a luxurious pod .
483,"The snack sizes are tiny. Considering what you charge for the flight you can do much better. I am a guest on your flight, and a paying guest as well. You would be embarrassed if that tiny size was what you served to a guest at your home."
484,"A CA totally forgot serving my wife's dinner and her first choice was not available because of that. In the Business Class, how does it happen????."
485,No.
486,Npot at this time.
487,No Thanks.
488,Please carry good single malt scotch.
489,Short flight no beverages.
490,"Small plane, no food service on this flight but that was expected. Cookies are always good!."
491,As our almost seven hour flight departed at 7:40pm an evening meal was really appreciated. The last meal we had was at 4pm and it is a bit soon to eat it as an evening meal. Being provided a meal on the plane meant not having to haul food onto the flight. Thank you for providing it.
492,"Asked for Biscoff, out of stock. Asked for Stroopwaffle, out of stock. Pretzel's are not even a good third choice. maybe you do not serve peanuts because some people are allergic."
493,"There was no dressing for the salad. both the chicken and quinoa were cold. The butter for the roll was also cold, which made it difficult to spread."
494,"hard to get bubbles, prosecco or champagne."
495,On the way from San Francisco to Paris we were given a delicious meal. On the way back from Paris to San Francisco we were not given a choice and the food was not excellent but satisfactory.
496,More healthy snack should be available.
497,No.
498,Getting very bored with the selection of the 3 boxes and their contents.
499,Portion make more satisfying/ a little bigger. Thank you.
500,It would have been nice to have more snacks available. The steward ran out of cookies halfway through the plane and only had pretzels left.
501,Polaris dishes much better FRA to IAH as compared with IAH to FRA. I requested the vegetarian entrees both times and I suspect at least parts of the outbound entree were supposed to be heated and they were not. The ice cold and hard offering was not palatable.
502,No.
503,Was unaware there would be a meal (glad there was). Boarding gate agent told me no meal unless you were in first class.
504,"The flight attendant was wonderful!. So was the Baileys and coffee,."
505,"There were only snack boxes offered. No real food , like a sandwich or something. The preorder only worked before the first flight. From LAS toEWR had no preorder."
506,"Brazilians like to have bread for breakfast, not only iogurt."
507,You show meals but never have them available.
508,"Very pleased at the vegetarian pasta selection -- delicious and glad to have the option presented. I had pre-ordered a vegan meal. however, which was not available. Prior to landing, only a turkey and cheese was available. which was not acceptable as a vegetarian."
509,No.
510,Mari the stewardess was helpful. the seating situation is not acceptable.
511,No.
512,..
513,No.
514,The food portion and selection can be better.
515,The quality of food has been maintained at a high level for years - even a bit of spicey food this trip!.
516,Chicken dinner did not taste well. Portion size was very small. Role was like a rock.
517,Breakfast was not enough - should have been a proper meal and not just a snack.
518,soda.
519,No.
520,Nothing was offered on flight from MEM to ORD.
521,The chicken was very unappealing and very spicy.
522,What food?. Tiny snacks for a 6 hour flight- what a joke!.
523,Flavored water was a nice addition.
524,"I thought $9 was a bit steep for a pretty small cocktail. Also, on the 3hr flight, I was only offered one chance to buy something."
525,Wanted fish. Stuck with pork and it was dry.
526,It would have been nice to be served a little snack on the plane.
527,For a fairly short flight they were fine.
528,No.
529,The red wine was cold!!!!.
530,"There was not even a bag of pretzels when we were being served the drink, disappointing!."
531,I would like another option besides pretzels although the ones served are very good.
532,I did not see any flight attendant serving food or beverage... hence no food or beverage chosen.
533,The food rating is 1. Horrible.
534,Service was slow.
535,Eggs for breakfast and the rest of the meal was pretty much inedible.
536,"Was around 8pm flight. First class, and no food was server. Snacks only. Same snacks I would get in economy."
537,"Would be nice to have Diet Dr Pepper, vitamin waters, some other choices than Diet Coke."
538,Should sell food in the flight.
539,"The fish selection was very good. The salad was very strange - I was not able to eat it. Food service was overall good, but still not the same as prior to Covid."
540,Had to ask for napkin Could have asked for refill.
541,Chicken over cooked and sauce gross. Otherwise meal fine.
542,10 for a shot and another 10 for a box of snack food come on $5 maby $7 for that. Each I can understand but $10 is a bit much. And no cash or cc options is bad for business.
543,"I was not a fan of the pasta because the flight attendant described it as having a cheese sauce, which was not the case, it had a pepper sauce, and I can not eat that. Besides that, it was great!."
544,No.
545,"Overall, disappointing quality of food. Especially compared with quality on many European airlines, notably Luftansa. No nuts were offered with beverage before meal service like you used to do. It was a nice, welcoming touch. Also, the quality of dessert has gone down - seems like something in cellophane that I would not buy at a convenience store. A premium cookie would be more appealing. Not that I need to eat dessert."
546,"Venice to newark was great. However Newark to Denver was terrible. Flight attendants great- but the chicken orzo meal tasted awful. and the chair had no kind of footrest. I was uncomfortable for the entire ride. Being 5 feet tall can not comfortably put my feet anywhere. I usually bring a stool, but I figured since paying for first class that I did not need to. Not worth the $$."
547,They have such a wide variety. the offerings were generous.
548,I never got my seafood entree and ended up with chicken tikka and it was barely edible. The salad was terrible. Ice cream sundae saved the meal.
549,There was no beverage service due to expected turbulence. the flight was very smooth with no turbulence.
550,It is a pretty long flight. You should offer more than a tiny package of pretzels for a $400 one way ticket.
551,Had to ask to receive pre-ordered items.
552,Most of the passenggers are from Taiwan. The type of food should have a choice of Chinese food.
553,More variety of snacks.
554,The coffee is very bland;. it would be nice to have a stronger brew. But I realize that I am from Seattle and I have become a coffee snob! <:-)>.
555,Dry and tasteless.
556,Couple choices of red wine.
557,"My husband and I travel frequently - usually using about 2 main routes. The meal choices in business class has been the same for the last 9 months - either chicken katsu or a tofu/cauliflower or broccoli offering. Both are heavy on starches, and the last time, the rice was not cooked all of the way - it was hard and chewy. I would have been happier with a fresh sandwich and some fruit or a charcuterie plate as a choice. Or something that was different than what we have been eating on those routes for the last 6 trips."
558,Wish you still took cash or credit cards in flight. I would have bought more.
559,more options should be given the long duration of the flight.
560,No thank you. I want to give the flight an A plus.
561,"My first leg on United was under 3 hours and I am unhappy with the new rule about no snacks for short flights. I appreciate pretzels along with my drink so much, even on short flights."
562,"not the SFO- DFW flight, but on international flights 2nd service (snack/breakfast) is less than average."
563,Need water available at all times in easy to locate places.
564,None.
565,All great.
566,Chicken and rice where very very dry .
567,Water tasted horrible. They gave chips between meals. We were hungry during flight.
568,Chicken dish was too ethnic with seasoning and vegetables. We were in premium plus seats and they ran out of 1st choice pasta.
569,No.
570,Do not like that you have to give credit card in advance.
571,My husband ordered a beer he did not get the full can just part he a glass. He asked for another one. they said they were out. I wanted a beer that was listed and they said they did not have it.
572,This is not a comment about flight from aruba but the one we took on 29 to aruba we did not get any snack offered which surprised me.
573,Only michelob Ultra as a lite beer option. Would like some other lite beer.
574,"After getting coffee, was never approached again about getting another beverage. (I was sitting up front)."
575,I do not think drinks were served.
576,It was a fairly late night flight. i had already eaten so i did not have an inflight meal. Just coffee and a coke.
577,"The food was just OK. For a Business Class flight, it should be better. The breakfast in particular was not that appetitizing."
578,I think the portion should be much larger on a three hour flight.
579,Or none.
580,"Stroopwaffel not offered, I would have chosen it [Stroopwaffel]. It was an pm flight."
581,Found the bar code w ordering at the airport a bit daunting and obnoxious. Prefer to go to a bar/Lou he interact w a bartender to order a glass of wine.
582,Small glass of soda no can is offered.
583,"I was glad they seemed to be fairly careful about keeping their fingers out of the cups. In contrast to other flights on United, it seemed that these attendants were planning to recycle the cups. Since we had a long delay in Billings, I wish they had served some kind of snack with the drink."
584,We were stuck on plane for 3 hours and they offered limited snacks.
585,Make sure there are enough of each option for all of 1st class.
586,I did not have the option to pre order for this flight. It would have been nice to do.
587,They only came by once.
588,Would have liked coffee for flight from Jackson Hole to Denver. And wanted more than a “snack” from flight from Denver to Cleveland. Had no real food until dinner at home.
589,No kids meal….‘my kids did not eat on both flights too and fro.
590,"The food needs to be improved on, especially the taste and quantity."
591,The snacks and beverages are very much appreciated - especially for those of us who do not have time to eat at the airport because of a late flight that almost causes passengers to miss their connecting flight (like mine).
592,Enjoyed the cheese tray.
593,"A lunchtime Turkey sandwich was given. horrible sandwich. tough, greasy. you guys should do better than that. a sandwich was the only thing given that you could not eat."
594,The pork was delicious.
595,nice.
596,Higher quality food please!!!.
597,The impossible meatballs are very good!. Keep them on the menu.
598,It was a very long flight. There was no mid flight snack offered and the sandwich we received before landing was not very good.
599,it was a limited selection of the food.
600,Better choice of free snacks please.
601,"Using points, or even paying out of pocket (as I did on the way from RDU to IAD), in order to upgrade to First Class - I expected there would at least be some champagne or supplies for a bloody mary available. I was definitely a bit disappointed that my only options, as I am starting a long trip or returning from a long trip, were water, juice, or coffee/tea."
602,No.
603,Yes This is over 5 hours fly you suppose to charge everyone $10/20 dollars more but give everyone a great snack sandwich and a nice glass of wine or 2 for people love wine you will win Hard to understand you do not do that yet I love United I was working in the fruit ship for 5-6 years when I was young long time ago After all I love United but cud be better like I just said and the plane magazine chair etc need to be very clean not a bit clean is not right you must work on it more clean yes.
604,More options for vegan and vegetarian.
605,Sandwiches.
606,"Please consider a plant-based, whole food option."
607,We were not given pretzel's or biscotti. What happened to that snack.
608,Only offered beer wine or soft drinks no option to purchase alternative beverages.
609,No.
610,Portions of first class food and beverages were generous. quality was lacking. Most of the main course was inedible. even the dinner roll was dried out.
611,Asked for ginger ale and received sofa water. Required more than one shout to get attendant's attention.
612,gelato / ice cream was fantastic.
613,they only serve one beverage at a time. Its almost impossible to get another if we wanted one. The option to order two could be more convenient if desired.
614,I has been a while since we have used United. It was sad to see United has cut back on snack and meal selections none of the four flights offered this. The beverage service was great.
615,I asked for 2 cranberry juice and was given 1 And was asked if both were for me.
616,Granola bars.
617,very happy to see and try the new menu...a big improvement!!!.
618,No.
619,No.
620,"We did not receive this survey for the first trip segment departing at GSP to DEN. Our comments refer to that segment. It was a 3hr.20min flight. The below info is stated verbatim from the United app. ""Flight status details"" ""Wed, Sep 14, 2022 | UA 5515 Greenville to Denver Food United First: Breakfast United Economy: Snacks available for purchase"" We did not purchase food that morning knowing breakfast of some sort would be served on the flight in first class. Unfortunately it was not!. The flight attendant came to us with a snack basket. We were puzzled and told not today, it was not loaded on this plane. We were quite disappointed. Thank you for listening."
621,Meal portion very small. Snack before landing far too small.
622,On flights of 5 hrs a complimentary meal should be served. We were given on snack. At least two should be offered on long flights.
623,The only thing that was offered in terms of a snack was a cookie or a biscuit. I was hoping to have pretzels or peanuts.
624,The selections and servings were ample. Very tasty.
625,No.
626,The food selections are not great. Even to purchase the boxes are just not good anymore.
627,Bigger variety.
628,Food is too simple. Flight attendants left empty glasses at my seat for hours.
629,"Bigger cups for water. It is water. I brought a huge bottle after TSA. was out 3 hours after flight started. I learned a lesson. Bring 3, 32oz next time. Got a couple eye rolls when I asked for more water."
630,More drink options.
631,It was unclear if we were able to order additional food or meals.
632,A small snack in first class as offered on previous flights and other airlines would be nice.
633,You need to add a starch with the hamburger…. like the home fries you have on the breakfast menu…. keep the hamburger…. it is reliable…add onion and a tomato slice with some home fried.
634,Gluten free option.
635,no.
636,"Great service, flight attendants were unable to offer pre-departure beverages because catering did not get to them until right before the door closed."
637,The snacks could use an upgrade but the drinks are good so...
638,Too much salt/too spicy. No real food taste. It will be difficult to satisfy every mouth. maybe you can work on this one.
639,It would have been nice to been offered a snack.
640,More water in a larger cup. No herbal tea or almond milk (for lactose intolerant) Also snack choice was limited.
641,"I wish there were more options for the snack, or be able to buy something different."
642,Snack before landing does not give enough variety. the couscous dish is awful.
643,Better organizing for boarding procedures. Too crowded and messy.
644,No.
645,Lunch chicken dish was outstanding. Very tasty.
646,need more variety.
647,"for a 5 hour flight in economy plus it would be good if came around a second time to see if wanted anything else (outbound flight came by only once, return flight came 1 hour before landing which was too close to landing)."
648,Nothing was served.
649,Neither the burger or chicken salad meals were available to preorder 5 days in advance yet were available to purchase on the flight. I pre-ordered items I really did not want to make sure I had something for 5 hour flight with a tight connection before the flight which limited the ability to get something to eat at the connecting airport.
650,most of the items offered were vegetarian - only one other option.
651,"In addition to Coffee / Tea, other beverages such as hot coco will be helpful. Tea can be offered with variety, such as green tea, other aromatic flavors, including the chai latte that has now become very popular."
652,We got ice cream in a cup that Wat completely melt like water.
653,"If there is a special meal option, like for diabetes, it would be nice if united would let ypu know about this."
654,"Would prefer a small, complementary munchie, but understand financial considerations."
655,The food I had was great. being in the last row of business class did not allow us the full menu as by the time the flight attendants got to us some of the choices were already gone.
656,I do not think any was offered unless I dozed off.
657,The breakfast did not have bread.
658,They were good. I appreciate you.
659,Larger quantity of beverage to drink.
660,Nonw.
661,None.
662,The hummus was bad - it [hummus] tasted spoiled and I got sick after eating it.
663,no.
664,Food was actually pretty good. I only drink water when flying and I had lots!.
665,Flavor was better than I anticipated. everything seemed fresh and well prepared.
666,No.
667,Appreciate the flavored sparkling water.
668,No.
669,I also purchased food but never received a receipt.
670,No choice but old dried up pretzels…another option or something new would be nice.
671,Bigger variety. I asked for water and did not get any ice with it. I think that is a first.
672,They ran out of a few items during the trip such as the grapefruit seltzer water.
673,There was no choice for the complementary snack: only pretzels.
674,It would have been nice to have a gluten free option. I made the burger work by removing the bun. the quality of the burger was NOT good.
675,Entree was cold!.
676,"This is in regards to the food in general (Houston to cun), you have to get rid of the zatar chicken. No one likes it. It is made fun of all across social media. I can not believe it is still being served. I can tell status flyers by what food they order. Also two vegetarian options is excessive."
677,Need something in the box to spread the jam spread. Need more sugar free or zero calorie beverages. Hot chocolate would be nice.
678,The complimentary meal tasted really bad. It would be better to just serve multiple non perishable snacks.
679,A wider choice of food would be welcomed.
680,No.
681,No service. Turbulence.
682,Water.
683,The cheeseburger I ordered had a HORRIBLE Bistro sauce. Yuck!!. Just give me a burger with sauces/condiments on the side. I could not even hide the horrible bistro sauce taste with the ketchup & mustard packets provided. Offer more normal foods and not all this wierd and crazy flavor combinations.
684,Service was excellent.
685,We were given a glass of wine prior to our mail but had a wine glass on our tray. nothing was offered!.
686,On the part of the flight attendants there is no complaint. the food is very bad.
687,A description of what the options for entree by the service staff would have been helpful. We were told “chicken or pork”.
688,no food or snack.
689,I love the coffee on United flights. I believe it is Ilia. I always look forward to it and it always delivers!. Keep up the delicious coffee please.
690,What is to say about a mini-bag of pretzels?.
691,Beef entree was very tough.
692,It would have been nice to be able to order some additional wine on a long flight.
693,No.
694,Requested crackers as was motion sick. Told none available Cranberry juice.
695,Serving size is ridiculously small. Offer 2 or up the package size.
696,The process to order food online was very confusing and frustrating. I got about half the info I needed.
697,Its a long 11+ hours flight... You need to have decent mid-flight snacks... Just chips are not enough...
698,"The meal I received was very salty, Chicken Risotto. I thoroughly enjoyed the cheese tray."
699,It was hard for me to order food on United app. It did not work.
700,"I wish you served something nutritional, like peanuts. I wish you had more variety in meals to be bought. The coffee is poor so I do not order it anymore."
701,no.
702,Should be able to pre-order Polaris meal on international flights.
703,The asian vegetarian meal was good. The snack was not. Just a dry breadstick with a little lettuce and quinoa in it. No flavor whatsoever. We did not finish it. I like the new asian vegetarian idea because your previous food for vegetarians was horrible.
704,"Enjoyed the fact that they gave us 3 snack options (pretzels, biscoff, or stroopwaffle). Also appreciated that we were given a full can of soda."
705,Meal was chicken breast. Thought it would be hot. Served cold. Still tasted good but not what I was expecting.
706,Can improve of food selection and variety.
707,The snacks to purchase were not healthy or considered a meal even though the time was 7pm.
708,The dinner that was served was okay. The main dish was pretty warm. the other items were ice cold. Better than many flights I have been on in the past. I know it is hard to feed a plane load of people and that your chefs work hard to make food palatable.
709,I did have dessert but had to ask for it as I did not receive it [dessert] with the dinner. The breakfast was a bit light.
710,considering premium economy.. the food was more on the low cost carrier side.
711,The chicken dinner was cold!!.
712,"While I did not order it on my most recent flight, I appreciate the option of sparkling wine and the Tapas box!."
713,Food should be served hot. It [Food] was cold and could not eat.
714,No.
715,no.
716,I slept through the lunch meal service. Would have been nice to get it [service] later. I wanted a gin and tonic and they had no gin.
717,Pork entree was good. the burger was not.
718,Chicken entree one of the best in flight meals I have had!.
719,I would appreciate more vegan items on the tray.
720,N/A.
721,No hard liquor served in premium economy.
722,The dessert was great. It it was not cold enough.
723,"The pre made ice cream sundae did not taste like vanilla ice cream and was very disappointing. The previous sundaes that allowed you to customize the toppings had a much better quality and taste for the ice cream. Please bring this service back, even if they sundae has to be prepared in the galley vice seat side."
724,Better choices.
725,Perhaps a choice would be good. A healthy option.
726,no.
727,At least some snacks.
728,No short flight.
729,food is too different to Italian food. we do not like sausage used whit meat.
730,Pretzels were not available.
731,My wife is Vegan and was not sure that everything in the meal was prepared without animal products.
732,Was essentially a snack box opened and put on a tray. Rather disappointing.
733,No.
734,No.
735,Again nice they did water service on a 40 minute flight.
736,"I am consistently frustrated with United's receipt delivery for on board purchases. See email from 9/9 (for which I have received no response):. For the better part of this year, I have struggled to get necessary receipts for inflight purchases. Where United used to simply email a receipt. now I receive emails like the attached, instructing me to click a link, enter information, only to be told “We could not find your receipt” (see screenshot below). I then have to call customer service, go through your ridiculous phone tree to get to a representative who then has to take a bunch of information and finally email my receipt. I do not get it. United emails my flight reservation receipts within minutes of clicking purchase. Why can not you do the same for inflight purchases like you used to?. Why make your customers go through so much trouble?. Why over tax what your customer service representatives with customer service issues like this?. I, like many, need these receipts for my business expense reports. They are important and need to be delivered to customers in a timely (same day) manner. I can not be the only one having this issue. I call every time and complain. the system does not improve. You need to do better."
737,no.
738,I would have like to know in advance that the meal was a cold meal and not heated. if I had known this I would have ordered a hot meal ahead.
739,Getting tired of chicken katsu.
740,The bacon cheeseburger second meal was not the usual excellent food that is served.
741,The service was good. food was ok.
742,"You do not offer any Canadian Blended Bourbons, only straight bourbon such as Buffalo Trace. I would prefer Crown Royal, Seagram's VO or Canadian Club. Most other Air Lines have one of these."
743,I love my drop off point very quick and efficient.
744,All the very friendly staff offered her a snack and drink.
745,I would have liked a decaf/ herbal tea selection esp on a red eye flight!.
746,Keep up the good work.
747,"Like I said, because of the switch from Lufthansa to United without sharing the passenger data and without letting me know (I asked to be informed by text message, since I had restricted access to e-mail, but I rarely received any information, not even when the airport was closed one day), I could not order my special meal/diet/vegetarian food."
748,The flight was less than an hour. Services were provided if you wanted something. I did not want or need anything.
749,all very good.
750,N/A.
751,Limited service with few choices.
752,Excellent.
753,No.
754,I was not offered the strop waffle. which is sad since I love them.
755,Domestic food was not so great.
756,There was no food served on the flight to Boston.
757,I pre-ordered and presumed it would be delivered automatically. I had to ask flight attendant for it.
758,"In business class. The initial meal main dish was fine/quite good, though not accompanied by the usual quality of condiments, and additional side dishes. Limited snack options between meals (none really). Second meal prior to landing was the worst cheeseburger I have ever eaten. You can do better on that."
759,Excellent service.
760,For such a long flight the availability of water to stay hydrated was so limited. The food was way too salty.
761,bread roll served cold.
762,"I am not sure that a Thai curry chicken option was the most universal of choices. I was not interested in the vegetarian lasagna, but maybe a more simple chicken choice would be better (chicken Parmesan for an Italian flight?)."
763,Other than portion size— all good.
764,My daughter and I were sitting in seat 55 and they ran out of vegetarian options for her by the time they got to us I feel like they should ask you before the flight so they can plan better for vegetarians. After we all ate later in the flight I went back and asked if they had anything she could eat. The sweet flight attendant fouls a staff meal for her that was left over if all the staff hand eaten their meals their meals she would not have eaten.
765,nothing offered except drinks.
766,There was a choice of main dish that was new. I did not know what some of the ingredients listed were. I have to avoid the nightshade family and could not tell whether there was any in it.
767,No.
768,Only water was offered.
769,I did not order any food because the options was slim.
770,"The complimentary pretzel snack should contain more pretzels. For a 3+ hour flight, I expect a larger snack portion."
771,"If I am in first class in the middle of the rows, the food options should not run out by then. The food really…it was hitting a very low bar for quality."
772,Just a big fan of the vegetarian entrees in general and the meatball/couscous one in particular. I want to cook a version of this at home!.
773,"The white wine was spoiled. I drinkable. Also only one alcoholic beverage was allowed. Considering the price of fares, at least one before dinner and one with the meal should be offered,."
774,Just open cups of water are not really good in my opinion.
775,I preordered the falafel meal option online. Flight attendant informed me that they change the option and apologized.
776,Not much it is a short flight.
777,The food box can be improved. It is was not the best for me.
778,Flight was very bumpy so only offered water.
779,not even a simple snack was offered.
780,Not a fan of contactless ordering.
781,N/A.
782,"I miss the snacks, but my waistline does not. <:-D>."
783,My husband did not get his kosher meal. I did. we were listed on the same itinerary.
784,"My main issue is that on a 5 hour long flight in economy I feel you should get a main meal as part of the fare. You do, say, in Australia. I feel its penny pinching to not to this. However on one of my flights I ordered the taco box and it was nice."
785,Could be better like a sandwich at least for a long flight like that.
786,"We have a problem on planet Earth with too much plastic use, manufacture & pollution. I feel you are NOT doing anything to reduce plastic use. Every drink is served in a plastic cup and discarded. And what about all of those small 6-7 oz. plastic bottles. Please use biodegradable bamboo or paper cups and large refillable containers of water for distribution into cups. Thank you."
787,No.
788,Not many options for snacks.
789,Bring back separate dessert in economy - the mini ice creams.
790,Not right now.
791,the flight attendants do the best they can so i commend them on both flights we were delayed going out 5 hrs due to storm they should have offered light drinks and snacks after 2 hours.
792,I was surprised at the quantity and quality of the takeoff food box.
793,I am allergic to peanuts and all tree nuts. You should have a meal option for that.
794,We were first class. there was not a hot meal offered which was disappointing.
795,Meal was piping hot.
796,no.
797,No.
798,No sabia si era gratis o había q pagarla.
799,It was airplane food. LOL.
800,Bring back snack boxes.
801,It was great.
802,Not at this time.
803,The oatmeal breakfast option is especially good.
804,It is confusing on how you are supposed to order food and beverage if wishing to purchase. As for the complimentary it would be nice if they had a card so you know ahead of time with the flight attendants have to offer they only have so much time and they have a lot of people to serve so it would be easier than having to ask or them having to list everything. It would also be nice to have a bigger variety of snack options offered not everyone can eat cookies and pretzels.
805,"most of it was fairly bland, on the flight over from LAX to London, not as i recall offered any options, as i was in the back of the plane, may have run out of what i would have liked more than what i had."
806,Very limited vegetarian options No alcohol free beer.
807,"4 hour flight, one drink?. I think we should get 2."
808,United needs to improve the meals that is served.
809,It is always a little uncertain if you can get a coffee or snack.
810,I enjoyed the food. the chicken entree was really too salty.
811,Nope.
812,No.
813,Would like enjoy a refill.
814,"In general terms and for airplane food and drinks it is acceptable, but in the case of snacks it is very little and without variety..."
815,"It would have been nice if a snack or snacks were offered, e.g., pretzels, cookies, nuts."
816,No.
817,I wish the flight offer snack like the other airline does.
818,Add a fresh non-dairy creamer as an option for the coffee.
819,I was unable to make any purchases since I could not get the app.
820,Seemed to be the same two options in First that I have had in the past.
821,No.
822,was only water offered.
823,A small snack would have been nice.
824,"This was a short flight so there was not a real beverage service, but I did appreciate that they came around with water/juice since sometimes air travel gets very dry, or you anticipate something to drink on board, so the fact they were able to do this on the short flight was appreciated."
825,"For the flight from Newark to Providenciales there were only snacks, meals or more elaborated snacks would have been nice."
826,My salad shaker was served to me frozen...
827,The fruit had no taste. you do not offer bread or pastries like other airlines.
828,"only received a survey for the final leg of my trip, the dinner I had on the previous section was overall good but the main dish (chicken something), the chicken was quite dry and the dish itself was not particularly good. I did not finish it. I am not a picky eater and hate wasting food."
829,the chicken salad shakeup was a pleasant surprise.
830,None.
831,The flight attendant forgot me.
832,"I have an allergy to onions. In the past trip to Europe, I was given options."
833,"You ran out of the pasta dish very quickly. I was not happy about it. When people order the tickets online, take a survey with the different dinner options and let them choose which one they want to have."
834,"The flight attendant did not offer much explanation of the choices. She just said ""chicken or pasta"". I normally prefer chicken, but would have appreciated a little more description like ""butter chicken"" or ""chicken curry"". (I am not sure what exactly it was, even after receiving it.)."
835,"We felt the dinners provided were very good. We went out to dinner. my husband had the same meal as on the plane. He felt the plane meal was much better,."
836,The breakfast was pretty good we also had yogurt with the breakfast and fresh fruit. The fruit was very good nice and fresh!.
837,"Tried to buy more snack options, but lots of items listed were not available on that particular plane, and the ones that were were out of stock."
838,Tomato juice is my choice.
839,Should have provided at least a bottle of water.
840,"pretty meager offerings, out of beverage choices."
841,All good.
842,Online pre-order info to the attendants was confusing or not available.
843,na.
844,The chicken dish is good but seems to be served almost all the time on the cross-country flights I take. It is getting tiresome and it is time for some additional options.
845,Please add herbal teas to selection of beverages.
846,No.
847,It was a late flight leaving Maui and by time we got our food it was very late.
848,No Chardonnay!!!. Gotta have Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay.
849,No.
850,"United needs to change up their snack offering, 2 choices are fine. You should try to make your snacks more exciting."
851,"In First Class, please return to the practice of offering a drink (any drink) before takeoff. Typically no drink is offered other than a glass of water."
852,I did not see ahead of time what was available for purchase on the flight.
853,There is not cofee on the morning!!!.
854,The flight was long. The ticket very expensive. So to have to purchase food other than the cookies was a lot.
855,Would have liked a second beverage service like they did on the flight from Chicago to Seattle.
856,Not really due to short trip.
857,Its a short flight and usually has turbulence. But offering instead of expecting passengers to ask is always better.
858,Know.
859,None-too short a flight.
860,More options.
861,"First class meal was stated on the United booking site as Dinner. Pre-packaged cheese, little bags with nuts, fruit, dry cookie were not a dinner. There was no other choice."
862,Not.
863,You really need to provide gluten free/coeliac/wheat allergy/intolerance meal options. These are really not uncommon.
864,The Cheese Burger on arrival was slightly scary - very dry. had some strange bacon pieces on top the ketchup and mustard helped the partial coonsumption.
865,I loved the Thai green curry chicken that we were served for lunch!.
866,No everything was just fine. It was the outgoing flight where we had the problem.
867,No.
868,Would have liked a diet 7up or Sprite. Thank you for recycling cans!.
869,Would have liked a selection of snacks. Only had pretzels and the bag was tiny.
870,N/A.
871,My entree was way too spicy. I noticed the gentleman next to me did not eat his either. Considering the meatballs were meatless there was not much to choose from. Would like to be able to have some choice of condiments.
872,none.
873,There was no free snack offered. It is usually a small item. on this flight there was nothing given out.
874,Water could be offered more often on long flights.
875,"Food options better on London to SF than from SF to London. Ice cream - would have liked choice of flavors, but it was much better than the frozen icecream I had on my outbound flight."
876,Middle snack was a lump of cheese and some crackers but no knife or easy way to cut.
877,No.
878,No.
879,No.
880,"All was great.. prefer Merlot, but any Red is better than no red.."
881,more choice.
882,Brioche burger was oily and greasy.
883,I would like to have a Sauvignon Blanc option for wine!.
884,Too many plastic bags for all the food. Quite uncomfortable to consume with all the little bags to open and dispose etc. Not very friendly to the environment. Maybe consider a cardboard/paper tray with all the selections and a single plastic wrap?.
885,Would be nice to see an upgrade to the white wine. Barely a step up from the limited airline selection.
886,The snack was a hot Turkey & cheese sandwich - it was fine. The food on way to Paris was awful.
887,This is the first time that the food (in 1st class) was not particularly tasty. Surprised by that.
888,The flight attendants were great.
889,A free snack should be provided with the beverage.
890,Not sure why but there were no pretzels or small free snacks.
891,The fish I had was terrific.
892,Be nice if you changed up the snacks every once in a while.
893,My food could have been hotter for lunch. The afternoon beef burger was perfect and really tastey!.
894,I do think presentation could be a bit better. I liked that there were 4 options. Salads were a bit sad looking. A better dessert for lunch before landing would be nice. Even a piece of chocolate- pre wrapped muffin was not good and just looked cheap on the plate.
895,The beers are most often not very cold.
896,The best part of the service was the hostesses cheerfulness as she served.
897,The taste looks different.
898,Service was great. The food was terrible.
899,"They said to short of a flight, still should have offered beverages."
900,Wish there were specified gluten free options.
901,Has United discontinued it is free snacks with the beverages?. I was expecting that. nothing was offered.
902,No.
903,Everything was excellent.
904,Well done.
905,"No IPA, alright. Moved to spirits. Piece of dental floss, used, in tiny crevice below drink tray. Removed with alcohol swipey. /cs."
906,Very basic and somewhat boring.
907,There was no menu. I asked the attendants about the food and they did not have answers. Can you bring the menus back?. I have food allergies. I like to read the offering so I can choose appropriately. Thanks.
908,None.
909,Nothing.
910,Can we bring Tito's back?.
911,Got no snacks.
912,You need to find something other than those snack boxes. They have run their course.
913,"Noticed that flight attendant only offered 1 glass of beverage choice to each person she served, then poured all the opened partial cans together to dispose of additional liquid into an empty water container. It seems more logical to offer each party served the beverage can after it has been opened and served to limit so much waste."
914,"My problem here was I was never notified to pre-order my meal. I tried several times to log on and I got on the app to pre-order, but could not get it. Our first flight I received an email with a link. Return flight, never received anything. So by the time we were on the plane there was only 2 options left, neither was very exciting. Thank you for listening."
915,Need a larger selection of bourbon.
916,No.
917,The chicken dish which I had on my flight to Denver was too spicy. the other choices were inadequate.
918,"I got instant coffee when I asked for decaf. If I had known that, I would have gotten something else. Also, the cookies were delicious but it was a small package."
919,I slept. My issues were with the international leg.
920,Allow more than one drink per person at a time. This is the only airline I know of that does this.
921,"Could have served on a 2 hrs plus flight that was delayed by 2.30 hrs,."
922,Taste is good.
923,I would Like the entire bottle of water and not just a tiny cup.
924,For a 6.5 hour flight it would be nice if there was other smaller snack options that followed the main meal service. Once we were served the breakfast that was it for snacks or food whereas some other airlines come around again with a snack basket or toasted nuts etc.
925,No. I had water.
926,"If you are going to send out an email saying you can pre-order food five days to 1 day before departure, make it available. every time I looked it was unavailable. So it was like a bad joke."
927,only offered water - 57 minute flight.
928,A few healthier snacks.
929,Too expensive. How about fruit or sandwich or something.
930,The breakfast options and the overall presentation for a business class ticket at this price were completely unacceptable. You can do better!.
931,Coffee cold.
932,Is it not possible to offer nuts because of people's allergies?. I miss peanuts or something savory other than pretzels.
933,Ice cream was melted like water (was clearly did not follow the cold chain) Breakfast was only a small snack.
934,Snack size of pretzels was very small. Only 2 snack choices.
935,"Presentation of wines was very good, but please upgrade the quality of the sparkling wines offered. Of late they have been sweet and not very effervescent. I wish you would offer something like Emirates does in business class such as Veuve Cliquot. The staff does the best they can given the choices."
936,No.
937,Nothing is served .
938,Start serving drinks early.
939,I had a infant in lap ticket for my toddler. She is 1 year and 11 months so it would have been nice to have some sort of baby food option like plain white rice. I was satisfied with my special vegetarian meal. Thank you!.
940,The Thai veggie curry was delicious.
941,no.
942,I am fine.
943,"The option to pre-order a meal is fantastic. The desert options need to be more than a small round brownie or cookie. You need to bring back cheesecake or ice cream as an option, or a desert that is more seasonal in nature."
944,it was good.
945,"I did not know what to expect with ""complimentary"" food and beverages. From Chicago only beverages were offered (size plane?). , From Orlando, larger plane or time of day, I was offer beverage and snack."
946,short flight expected little food and beverage and that is what i got.
947,the z'atar chicken was the tastiest airline food I have ever eaten.
948,I would like to see a third wine choice.. a sweet wine for guests who do not drink reds or Chardonnay.
949,"What a great idea to preorder, this way you get something that you can eat."
950,"You should serve some snacks, chips or nuts."
951,"If I had not asked the flight attendant for my Tapas box, I would not have received it. Seems kind of silly to have people order food in advance, associate that order with their seat number, and then not offer the passenger the pre-ordered food unless they ask for it. This should be automatic."
952,I think they should allow people to use their credit cards to purchase alcohol beverages on board without having to store the credit card in the app.
953,Great coffee.
954,Nice to have vegetarian options.
955,I did order wine before the flight.
956,Burger was bad…not sure how a burger could taste that way. Took 2 small bites and could not eat anymore.
957,I only had the pretzels.
958,Salad was brown and inedible.
959,Refund my additional payment for Economy Plus!. You failed to deliver an exceptional service.
960,Nothing was provided.
961,Please continue to offer the chili.
962,The chicken was very dry. But since this was a morning flight I wish they would offer more breakfast or lunch items and not heavy dinner type meals.
963,Complimentary soft drinks not offered. No snack pretzels.
964,I would like to see better snacks like chips.
965,I was not offered a snack of any kind on this flight. Just a drink.
966,Desserts are awesome!. Chocolate chip tartlette is amazing!. Please never let that item go. And caramel wafer cookies are also delicious.
967,Try to up your vegan game including vegan desserts.
968,The food was really good and such a surprise!.
969,Just needed water at times. Few runs from flight attendants seemed. Every 2 hours should be offer for water.
970,It would be nice if you offer at least one kind of local beer ( Departure Country ).
971,When did you stop providing an alcoholic beverage to comfort plus customers?.
972,"water, no ice. No longer any snacks served."
973,I would add LACTOSE FREE (for lactose intolerance people).
974,My dish had shredded cheese wgich should have neen melted in my opinion. It was not. The meal did not seem to have been heated at all.
975,Even a bag of pretzels would of been nice.
976,"I ate at DIA so did not eat on the plane. Cocktails were, well, cocktails!."
977,No.
978,No.
979,"Please offer more vegetarian or healthy options - plant based entrees, oat milk, overnight oats (as an alternative to yogurt) - the usual breakfast choice of French toast or eggs is not a good one."
980,You’re good.
981,This was a terrible terrible experience.
982,"The pesto cracker things were good. Thai green curry chicken was surprisingly good for airplane food. It looked like they had more than one kind of sandwich but they were kind of just tossing them to people, and we had to ask for them. It was decent."
983,All was great and tasty.
984,Thank You.
985,There were not options.
986,I was surprised there were no snacks.
987,Only water available. No other drinks and no snacks of any kind.
988,I love the flavored seltzer water called Aha.
989,We were told only one snack - that is all that is allowed gratis With the choice of only pretzels or the cookies it is bare bones!.
990,"I know it was only a one hour flight, but 1st Class should at least be offered at least a snack, even if only pre-packaged."
991,United would do well to serve some small snack (like the competitors) with the complimentary drinks.
992,Not enough water was served.
993,I have had better meals. The supper was just okay. The breakfast was really light. A little more for breakfast would have been nice.
994,No complimentary snack was made available.
995,"The main chicken course was delicious, tasty. just the portion was too small. I was truly surprised since it has been a long time since a meal selection was actually tasty. Pleasant surprise. Now execute on other flights because the outbound Denver London dinner meal was gross."
996,The lunch and snacks were great.
997,We paid for premium seats ( (Step below first class) - Delta provides free drinks & upgraded snacks - All United gives is extra legroom.
998,Too short of a flight for service.
999,Excelente.
1000,The breakfast was poor.
1001,"The breakfest could have more options, because sometimes people are in a comnection and do not have time to eat between."
1002,I actually had a snack box on the flight as well as a cocktail and was happy to discover that as a 1K member that snack boxes and drinks are free if you are in economy plus. I did not know that. The flight attendants were great serving me.
1003,Food was ok. It could be better.
1004,no.
1005,"I felt the price points on all of the food offered was reasonable. If there had been a kids snack box offered, even if you had to pre-order it, I may have gotten it (Uncrustables sandwich, applesauce pouch, snack pack of cookies, red licorice). My kids decided to order the Recline box but some of the items were too spicy, but they liked the salami and crackers and the cheese spread (was their reason for ordering the box)."
1006,Well done United Airlines.
1007,"Was first class, was a chicken pasta meal that was served cold should be hot, it no way to serve meal hot, then just serve a sandwich or salad that should be served cold, pretty simple can not heat it do not serve it, serve what should be cold."
1008,"Would be nice to have a slightly healthier/substantial option- we have cookies or waffle cookie- something like nuts, pretzels or a small granola bar would be great!."
1009,Other.
1010,"The lunch entree was much too salty for my taste. The dessert was overly sweet. Both seemed to be lesser quality, with salt and sugar used to artificially enhance flavor."
1011,Provide a hearty snack. It is difficult for old folks to do all this online including choosing our meals. Sister did not have the mobility to go outside and purchase food before her flight. She was not comfortable buying food once inside of the airplane.
1012,Fresh brewed coffee was actually good.
1013,Could give bigger bag or 2 per person.
1014,was not offered the choice to purchase food. Flight attendants only came by quickly to get trash but you could not even get there attention to give it to them.
1015,"running low on ice and ginger ale when got to me, so I only got 1/2 a cup."
1016,food quality and selection not up to pre-covid standards.
1017,Love the stroopwaffles.
1018,"Short flight, no food or beverage served."
1019,"Meal was tasty, hot not over cooked."
1020,"Taste was Nasty, chicken with quinoa."
1021,Dinner was fine;. breakfast was a leather egg.
1022,Real Milk.
1023,No tea o decafcoffe.
1024,I sat in business class my wife were in economy class food was average comparing with Qatar emirates n Turkish n etihad it was no competition economy no food was offered they must start providing food in economy we did not even know there were food suppose to order by paying they must ask n give the menus to purchase food.
1025,I prefer pretzels. there were none available on this flight.
1026,I realize it is awkward for the flight attendants to enforce. I think there should have been a limit on the alcohol served to my inebriated neighbor.
1027,2 snack choices?. Try Delta's.
1028,Everything was delicious.
1029,Was offered a drink with dinner which was great then a little tiny bottle of water just once. Check out Singapore Air they do it right. Constantly walking and asking what can they get you and not pooping it into tiny cups.
1030,"I did not get to chose my breakfast prior top the flight. That being said, I was in first class and was in row four, by the time the attendant got to me I was informed that their was only one meal option available as the other option (scrambled eggs) was depleted. In my opinion, THIS IS NOT FIRST CLASS VALUE. Granted I do not like eggs so in the end I was not too upset but the fact that the other option was depleted by the time the fourth row was served makes me question the value of paying for a first class ticket."
1031,There were none.
1032,"I loved the sparkling wine they offered me as soon as I boarded, instead of just a box of water."
1033,"Unfortunately, no meal on a 5 hour flight unless purchased. Other airlines offer meal choices at no fee."
1034,No.
1035,Long flight from Newark to Denver at 730 am no offer of snack only beverages.
1036,Limited.
1037,I am not satisfied with the new limit of one alcoholic drink per person. It imposes an extra burden on the flight attendants and would seem to me to lower your income. Two seems a reasonable limit.
1038,More choices.
1039,it would be nice to go back to pretzels or peanuts. i was starving. my fault i know to board hungry.
1040,From boarding till landing customers are inside the aircraft approximately 8 hours. Do not you think you have to serve more substantial food than just a snack? !!!.
1041,It was all good <👍🏼>.
1042,Southwest offers pretzels now .... peanuts are FAR better.
1043,More food options.
1044,No.
1045,It would have been nice to have a small snack.
1046,"The snack sandwich was poor tasting, very little ham & cheese on a tasteless bun. Surely you can do better!."
1047,Love sparkling water and it was available on all flights.
1048,"I love pasta with tomate souce, without cheese. Milk, no coffee, only milk, or hot chocolate."
1049,We were skipped with the breakfast service. We had to ask for breakfast.
1050,There were two California Sauvignon Blanc - could have mixed it up better!. No European whites at all.
1051,"Would love to see more food options, small water bottles (instead of water poured from a larger bottle), pretzels with salt, Pepsi products and more boxed meal options. Thank you!."
1052,"Not enough water served during the flight. At the beginning, I asked the flight attendant for two bottles of the water. she made a face."
1053,Great selection.
1054,not a big list of food to choose from.
1055,Would be nice if united had signature cocktails on this flight.
1056,No.
1057,"I would like to know if the entrees were dairy free. If not, no problem. I can eat the roll snd drink done juice. It is frustrating not to know. The steward was so nice. we agreed not worth taking a chance on getting sick."
1058,"The food was too much spicy, very too hot for me."
1059,"Comparing the food and wine selection in Polaris against other Star Alliance carriers, this was disappointing."
1060,Finally a decent meal in first class after two years of bad stuff.
1061,Why do airlines charge for everything?.
1062,Dinner was okay but should have been Italian. Breakfast was less than satisfing. Scrambled eggs would have been better or even a bagel and cream cheese instead of yogurt.
1063,"although flying has been pleasant, it is always nice to receive a beverage on my flight. there was not an offer of a beverage on this flight (to and fro). it was a bit disappointing. i personally feel that all flights should offer a beverage of some sort. thank you."
1064,There was no snack like a bag of pretzels or the like.
1065,Yes.
1066,I did not partake of the beverage & food service on this flight because of the flight's short duration. This form would have been better designed if the first question had a “not applicable” option so I could skip all the rest of this nonsense.
1067,If pretzels get any smaller we will need a magnifying glass to find them. Also on a 3.5 hour flight a full can of soda is not unreasonable to expect.
1068,Would have been nicer to have local beverages.
1069,Ice for drinks.
1070,No.
1071,The roll was too dry.
1072,No.
1073,More choices of hot food would be better.
1074,A continental breakfast usually has a muffin or croissant. This continental only had fruit and yoghurt. Pretty sketchy for a continental. Not the full meal. Other meals were not appetizing to me. Tried eggs/potatoes on flight IAD to SFO. Not appetizing. Glad club food has improved. Saved the day.
1075,light snacks would have been ideal.
1076,please serve the tea hot !. not lukewarm.
1077,Can you serve green tea also instead of just black tea?. Otherwise the food was good for both the meal and the warm cheese snack. It was good.
1078,Please offer a fish option.
1079,"As discussed previously on this feedback. JHB-Newark. Newark-LOndon(my daughter). The only option was curry. We personally do not eat curry and would prefer a simple meal of chicken,vegetables and rice."
1080,More of a snack maybe 2 When covid bags were handed out with snack and water very nice!.
1081,We were not offered a snack only a beverage. I would like to know what the criteria is for offering a snack.
1082,Coffee was terrific.
1083,The chicken and spinach dish in business class was terrible.
1084,No snacks.
1085,"flying 1st clas, i was ""hoping"" a better selections of snacks or even food (sandwich?). being offered, but none at all!."
1086,Pretty typical across airlines.
1087,no beverage service.
1088,There was no ice on the flight.
1089,"The food was delicious!. My husband and I actually FINISHED our food for the first time on United. (We flown four round trip first class to Narita via Houston, LAX and SFO thus far this year and DID NOT like our food on the international flights to Asia). As a matter of fact, we purchased our own food prior to boarding our NRT flight on the last two trip. We will be going from IAH to NRT again on Oct. 4th and WILL PURCHASE food @ local restaurants to bring on board for our international flight from IAH to NRT even though we are in business class. (International food service on EVA and Singapore airlines are excellent as compared to United). With those two airlines, we know we will be able to eat their food and will not need to bring our own). EVA air actually have hamburgers with fries as a snack item in business class."
1090,soda (Coke) was flat.
1091,I wondered why the airline was no longer providing complimentary snacks. Its a silly little extra but for the price of an airline ticket it somehow made it seem like a nice perk.
1092,I appreciate that you still offer free water and snacks.
1093,No.
1094,For snacks there was only the option of a turkey cheese sandwich. No vegetarian option was provided.
1095,Chicken pieces included gristle.
1096,"I really liked the hot chocolate chip mini muffin for dessert. I asked my flight attendant if I could have another one of those. She said, ""let me see what I can do"" To my surprise. she came back with a freshly heated mini chocolate chip muffin. I loved the service of my flight attendant."
1097,I did not take any of the snacks .
1098,You should offer Dr. Pepper diet/zero and Mt Dew diet/zero.
1099,The vegetarian couscous dish was good prior to arrival. I think that the presentation and side dishes as well as in-flight snacks should be a bit better quality to compete with other airlines.
1100,Would have appreciated a snack. Luckily I had “emergency cookies” with me.
1101,"The complimentary snacks were slightly for substantial. the beer selection was of fresh, local offerings."
1102,was not asked for my meal preferences in advance on this flight as I was the flight going over. Inconsistent w processes leaving and returning to IAH.
1103,It would be nice to have regular service but maybe flight time too short?. Maybe pretzels or cookies too ?.
1104,"Attendant missed our row for the second round of drinks and being is so close to landing, I did not bother to make a big deal out of it. Just not feeling good when we were skipped."
1105,No.
1106,I liked the direct flight from IAD to AMM.
1107,The food was better Chicago to Frankfurt.
1108,Todo bien.
1109,"I was in Business Class. food was fine, but not nearly as good as in Business Class on Singapore Air."
1110,The yogurt and fruit with the waffle breakfast is a nice touch.
1111,"Most people who did not pre order, did not have food they wanted. Some had to settle for a snack box."
1112,"I remain disappointed that United does not offer economy passengers a free snack as American, Southwest, and Delta do."
1113,The white wine offered was not tasty. Something was off in its taste. The pretzel sandwich that was offered prior to landing was high in calories/greasy/ and no other option was available nor offered.
1114,Bring sprite zero or no sugar sprite back. It is good as a mixer and also has no caffeine.
1115,It was served efficiently. cabin crew attended very quickly to any requests i made.
1116,"Before arrival there was a snack/breakfast cold, would be better to have a hot sandwich or egg."
1117,It was great - flavorful and what I expected.
1118,I liked the old days when there was some food served even in the cheap seats. On the Dinner flight from Kona to SF there was nothing even to buy except a snack box.
1119,Chicken Katsu served cold. Unappetizing. Wish there were Mai Tai options to from Hawaii. Way behind the service levels (food quality) of Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines.
1120,Temperature of hot food was fine. Temperature of roll and butter was too cold. Food was better with other airlines we know.
1121,"Small portion for a long flight. Would like to at least get two items instead of only one. For example, pretzels and cookie."
1122,It was a short flight so only quick beverages were served and no snacks.
1123,Drinks had no ice and tasted bad. Never got out cookie that we always get.
1124,The item selection was good in the box. some the packaging was difficult to open.
1125,On flights where you sell fresh food please include the cheese tray on morning flights!.
1126,"Meal, snacks and dessert options need a refresh. They are rather basic and unappealing. Food offered in the Polaris lounge is ahead of the rest, but onboard food is quite the opposite of that experience."
1127,None.
1128,As a 1K customer the service has really declined. I think this needs to change for your loyal customers.
1129,Loved having a vegan meal option from honolulu to San Francisco <😋>.
1130,Should offer more water on planes.
1131,"I wish there were more food options besides just the snack boxes. If there had been some real food options, such as a sandwich or salad, I would have been more inclined to purchase a food item."
1132,Wonderful.
1133,No Tito's Vodka. Tito's is the best.
1134,Free messaging has been a no go the last two flights just wondering if it is just me.
1135,Offer more food options even to pay for it.
1136,It is fortunate that you get to your destination safely but it is all about cutting out small things to save money.
1137,"You serve Bailey's. Delta stopped serving Bailey's. Great meal but no snacks in between (ie, chips, cookies.... unless i was asleep and missed them)."
1138,Small portions and not enough food for dinner and breakfast.
1139,There were very limited food options available on board -.
1140,It was great to have a snack from Seattle to Denver. There was NOT a snack offered going from Denver to Seattle.
1141,No.
1142,"We had cheese, fruit and an IPA beer All served at a good temperature and with clean utensils/glasswear."
1143,Need to have more choices. I did receive an email about pre-ordering but I defiantly did not like those choices so I took a chance that there was something different. I took the one I would thought I like. It was so so.
1144,"All your representatives were very polite and pleasant, with the exception of one server who blatantly ignored me when asking all others of their choices. I say blatant as there is no way he could have thought he did as he did not address me at all. When I said hello to get his attention he ignored me, and when I touched his arm he looked around at me and I had to tell him without his asking me, what I would like. He did not apologize, he just handed it to me and moved on. I am a BLACK woman. he was white. That left a bad taste in my mouth as, not only is it wrong..... I have never in my 60yrs encountered such a behavior. Sorry my 1st experience was on your airline. Flight 2162 from Orlando to EWR 5:pm."
1145,Would be nice if they gave you a mini bag of pretzels to go w/ the free bevy.
1146,"not really, i am a poor eater."
1147,No.
1148,The food selections were the same on this flight as I had had on the flight the week before. The little hot chocolate chip cookie was amazing.
1149,Overall edible.
1150,I enjoyed the food very much. Well done.
1151,Either offer meals on every long flight ahead of time. Take the waffle offering OFF the list.
1152,Going back to give Sandwiches will be better.
1153,It would be nice to have a gluten free snack choice that is complimentary.
1154,Overall there is less and less of snack offered these days.
1155,Glad to see United Chefs using various spices in their dinners.
1156,"Even though it was a short flight. no snack was offered in first class. I asked for pretzels. 1 tiny bag was provided. Very Happy with the Buffalo Trace bourbon, but no Tequila available."
1157,Allow more options for allergy sensitive people.
1158,The breakfast was not ok.
1159,No guarana was offered!.
1160,"All is good , just focus on technological progress and research !. Water is just fine !."
1161,I could not purchase food with cash or card which was inconvenient since I did not have the app and did not know how to get it!.
1162,Was in first class did not get a drink prior to takeoff and only one drink during the flight while other passengers got refills.
1163,As a 1K was not able to get the meal I wanted they ran out.
1164,No.
1165,We asked a sorbet but it had already been defrosted and frozen again. …Not very safe!.
1166,None.
1167,Other people seemed to enjoy the beverages.
1168,No.
1169,Aeroplane food sucks. But I am not sure how to fix it [food]. I suspect you are doing your best.
1170,"There is inconsistency in first class service. Sometimes we are offered a pre-take off cocktail, other times a choice of two drinks (like water or mimosa for example), and other times, only water. in my opinion, there should always be a pre-takeoff cocktail because the boarding process takes a long time. we have paid for premium service."
1171,I would like hot food options for purchase.
1172,The chicken and impossible meat balls get old when you are a frequent flier. Most crews do not offer a box. Rarely an attendant with all but the entree— I think that is great!.
1173,"This flight is so short, I have to wonder why it is necessary to have a food service. I would be fine with NO food service on short flights that are small. Just my take."
1174,Love Mr & Mrs T's Bloody Mary mix.
1175,"Increase the snack variety, like peanut or almonds. Include beer and wine as complementary options."
1176,"need something to snack on, for some reason we did not get this."
1177,Great.
1178,It is nice when they give you a small snack. not both flights gave a snack.
1179,Good del toon from Ewr to Cancun was not very good.
1180,The food was fine but not particularly good. the sandwich served before landing was not at all appealing - again expect a little more on a 9 hour flight. However the flight attendants were great about coming around with water - they did not do that on my outbound flight.
1181,More selection.
1182,It was a 4 1/2 hour flight. we were offered no snack.
1183,Tiny snack would be appreciated.
1184,Disappointed with food offerings.
1185,I thought the food was not the best. My hamburger bun was very hard. Probably over heated. On my flight to Greece your food was excellent.
1186,The food was surprisingly good.
1187,I wished you provided the same offer to order in advance on my return trip to Newark.
1188,"For the first time in a very long time I had a meal as they have been inedible over the last several years. The scrambled eggs were delicious. Although it was not available on this flight, I love the idea of pre-ordering the meal."
1189,Want cheese & crackers & protein for snacks.
1190,Give a snack dessert thing first ( 9:30 at night). And give a better breakfast in am.
1191,"Would have preferred small bottle of water to glass, because timing is easier. Personally hate Stroopwaffles. Pretzels are fine."
1192,No snack was provided.
1193,No.
1194,It really would be great if you went back to the pre-COVID separation of courses. I am consistently finding that the entree is cold by the time I am done eating my appetizer.
1195,"First leg of flight did not even offer pretzels or peanuts. Second leg did not offer sugar free, caffeine free soda or gluten free snack."
1196,First I was happy to get a meal. Thank you. All in all the food was good. My only concern was the chicken was somewhat dry and tasteless. Thought you would want to know. Other than that it was very good. Thank you for the wonderful service!!!.
1197,Chicken curry was so good.
1198,No.
1199,"I am not a strict vegetarian, but I no longer ask for vegetarian meals because United lazily serves a very disappointing, bland and stale vegan meal instead. Clearly the difference between vegetarian and vegan is not yet understood. I miss out on the delicious ice cream whenever I order vegetarian. Also, I tried to reserve a vegetarian meal for my girlfriend (who is a strict vegetarian) but it kept glitching and no matter how many times I tried, it refused to save the request for this past flight."
1200,more selection please….
1201,I wish that there were a prompt for a vegan option upon ordering the ticket. I have went through my first flight without food since I did not know I should ask for a vegan option in advance.
1202,Everything is excelent.
1203,I have not flown United in a while and was pleased that an IPA was available on board. It is my favorite style.
1204,No.
1205,more variety would help a whole lot.
1206,It would be nice to have nuts for a snack —something healthy.
1207,My grandson and I both loved the burger and the salad selection on the menu. We ordered seconds since we shared. Very tasty.
1208,Nasty tasting wine. Very bitter.
1209,"Ran out of the non-vegetarian option, was quite disappointed."
1210,I would like to see more choices regarding snacks for purchase.
1211,No.
1212,More food.
1213,Very satisfying.
1214,I was pleased with the pasta offering.
1215,I flew Polaris and it was a little weird that out of four choices everyone was asked for a first and second choice and even with that some did not get either. It seems there were not enough of each choice on board.
1216,No.
1217,"I liked the opportunity to choose a meal before the flight, this allows you to know what you will be having."
1218,More hot vegetarian options.
1219,"On an earlier flight we purchased the snack packs and it was just bad. Stale food. And it did not work together. For example, we had cheese spreads that were too hard to spread and just broke the crackers. The flavors did not match. It was just like a box of random snacks you bought at Costco. Alaska Airlines does a better snack box."
1220,Wine was complementary which was a lovely touch.
1221,"The food options were generally good in Polaris Class. Unfortunately, I was not able to get any of my food choices as they had run out and my order was taken last. I had to take my last choice (pork) which I do not eat but needed to due to the duration of the flight. This was not the fault of the flight attendant who was very apologetic."
1222,Coffee.
1223,"Please add some more snacks. For 3 & Half hour flight , need some good snacks please. Thanks."
1224,"They did not have any snacks, only drinks."
1225,I could not buy anything because I can not use my card. flight attendant told me it is touchless purchase which is stupid. She said it is due to covid which is more stupid because we are sitting without masks but can not use my card due to coved. the stupidity of flight attendants amazes me.
1226,I miss the food United use to serve.
1227,"Obviously there is not time for a full beverage service on this flight, but a small bottle of water would be much appreciated."
1228,Great.
1229,There was not any….
1230,Would like to have protein only option.
1231,There was no snack offered and beverages selection was limited.
1232,Looking forward to the next flight.
1233,They should offer snack.
1234,"I am not really sure what was offered because I was asleep. I actually had feedback about the airport food/beverage options at the time of the flight: nothing in the gate area, had to go to a completely different gate area for it. But I realize there may not be anything you can do about that."
1235,"no, the service was good."
1236,I am fully satisfied with the beverages served in the flight.
1237,no.
1238,REALLLY good chicken thing. Spiciness was actually... spicy!. In a really good way. I would eat/order the chicken thing off a plane if it was offered.
1239,A snack would have been nice.
1240,This is the on. y time in about 6 flights I was able to eat the meal. I usually bring one onboard. I am lactose intolerant. you always have cheese or a dairy poeduct on your meals. I have tried vegetarian and kosher. they suck. Beverages are fine.
1241,On longer fights a heavier free snack option would be great other than pretzels.
1242,There was no food/snack. Only meals for purchase.
1243,Nothing available to purchase.
1244,no.
1245,Would like more choices of sodas. Coke and sprite are not my choice of good sodas.
1246,For the price difference food and beverage offerings should be better.
1247,"Compared to other flights, there seemed to be less wine options (maybe only 2 or 3 choices)."
1248,"have a more healthy options , like mix nuts or more organic less sugar snacks."
1249,More selection would be nice. I did not know the selections because I did not want to touch the magazine.
1250,The salad was a welcome change from the usual entrees.
1251,Breakfast was awful.
1252,it would have been nice to have a snack that you did not have to purchase.
1253,Food from Outbound flight was not palatable therefore did not consume on the inbound flight.
1254,No snacks on 2nd flight. Not loaded.
1255,The “croissant” was a waste of space for breakfast and was not good. The sides we pretty mediocre at best. Entrees we are pretty good but not amazing.
1256,I would really love some more healthy options like some fresh fruit or vegetables or a salad.
1257,"Breakfast was poor, just an yogurt and a quarter of a cookie."
1258,Unremarkable. The drinks are the least of the concerns.
1259,"On this flight I was not woken up for 2 snacks even though I had put on my screen to wake me up for that kind of service. Was a bit disappointed. However, the vegetarian pasta was nice."
1260,"for Internat'l flight back home so early in the morning, it would be nice to have some lighter food on the first meal and more of a lunch meal later in the flight. Our flight was 9:45 am."
1261,The cutlery is better wrapped and sealed for sanitary purposes.
1262,"It was great that a dinner was served before landing (in addition to the lunch served at the start of the flight) because we were all still on central time and were getting hungry again. Only improvements I would suggest are these: 1) would be great to be able to order what you want as a pre flight beverage, instead of just the 2 choices of water and sparkling wine. 2) Would be nice to be able to pre order meals- my daughter did not enjoy her entree but it was all that was left. Thanks!."
1263,Very limited supply/offering of just water after the main drink serving (which was 2) time. I believe there should be additional water offered 3-4 more times on this type/length of flight.
1264,the beer was not cold.
1265,"I understand, that this was a short flight, but a bit more variation of snacks, would be fine and that snacks are available on bord."
1266,Add root beer.
1267,Would have liked the entire can of Coke.
1268,"This is regarding the flight from SBA to DEN. not Denver to Madison. The pilot out of Santa Barbara asked for a different plane due to mechanical issues, and oddly as a result the ground crew at the airport told us that there would be no snacks available to us. Why could not they get the bags of cookies/pretzels off of the other plane?. We were told this as we were boarding. Not that a cookie or pretzels are super important but till odd..... At least we had beverages. We did not have time at that point to go buy food or beverage from the airport gift shop. All was fine on the flight DEN to MSN."
1269,"Unlike my flight from IAD to LAS, I did not receive an email advising me to choose my meal for the LAS to IAD flight. I assumed there was not meal for my late night flight but was pleasantly surprised when I was on the airplane and received a meal."
1270,Somewhat disappointed in selection/ variety of both complimentary and for-purchase snack selection. Early morning flight and for-purchase options were mainly lunch.
1271,offer a greater variety of snacks.
1272,No.
1273,thankfully for your complementary beverage.
1274,"Regarding food choices in the Business First cabin (for which I am grateful for the upgrades), it has been ~3 months that the same food items (Chicken Pasta or Vegetarian Meatball) have been offered as the two choices in Business First. While I find both meals to be good, I think it may be time to offer other meal selections."
1275,N/A.
1276,"the taste of the meal is not great. for an international flight as long as 8 hours, we can deserve a better quality."
1277,Waffle did not come with butter. which i felt was odd. Seems like there should have been packets available.
1278,Those waffle cookies with my coffee were delicious!!!!!.
1279,The options always depress me. the food for sale is often money poorly spent.
1280,The entree was bitter tasting.
1281,No.
1282,"Green tea should be offered and things without so much sugar like at least Coke Zero or other alternative drinks without sugar. Diet soda does not count. With so many snacks out there, the choice of dry pretzels or plane cookie is not great. Why bother almost. How about a nice protein bar or something like that would be nice."
1283,There was not any food nor beverage service on this very brief flight.
1284,All reasonably good.
1285,My meal box made me feel full.
1286,The food is pretty awful - better than during COVID restrictions. you can do better.
1287,Very limited food service for a 5 hour flight.
1288,No.
1289,forgot to give me Biscotti on 1 of the flights.
1290,"Sorry, was commenting on first flight from SFO to CHI. There were not food/bevages on flight from CHI to ORD, so N/A."
1291,"For a 2.5 hour flight, I feel that they should be able to serve more than one drink (either non alcoholic or alcoholic)."
1292,More food/ meal options would be greatly appreciated.
1293,"Yes, they ran out of water!. Not good!."
1294,Food was bland and not good. Chicken dish. Food used to be better. Now it seems it is more about making it tasteless and offering specialty choices. Not an emphasis on any type of flavor.
1295,"Needed to pay attention for the food meal is ordered by passenger. If is A, is not B to be delivered."
1296,We had breakfast before we arrived. I had the eggs. The sauce was questionable. The sausages were not great. the fruit did not taste great. Plain grapes would have been better.
1297,The food an beverage on my Edinburgh to Newark flight was ok. The food and beverage on my flight going to Edinburgh was absolutely terrible.
1298,No.
1299,no food.
1300,Service appeared late...... to the point that they were picking up waste just before landing and could not complete the beverage.
1301,I did not eat the frozen dessert because the container was opened. I would of appreciated a second round of beverages after the meal.
1302,Sandwich.
1303,Do not remember being offered any snacks on this 1+45 flight...
1304,the flight attendant was complaining that her device was not working that allows you to purchase beverages. She mentioned it often does not work.
1305,"New Orleans to Houston is a very short fliught, so did not expect food/beverage. But this is my only chance to comment that there was no food/snack on any of the other 3 legs of this trip when the flights were longer."
1306,Nope.
1307,No.
1308,"The food was excellent. I have the chicken and my husband the burger on our way to Santo Domingo. Coming back to the states, I had the meatballs and my husband the steak and it was delicious. My husband was even trying to get the recipes."
1309,Should be able to buy with card and not having to download app.
1310,Its the same menu selection for months!.
1311,No coffee or hot tea due to broken hot water.
1312,"I would,lie to see Sprite Zero. No sugar, no caffeine. Hit competitors serve it."
1313,All good.
1314,All good!.
1315,"Beverages are always fine. the 2 cookie choices offered also taste good. However, in my opinion pretzel snacks, etc should be larger. For the amount of money airlines charge, and the fact the passengers are crammed into ever tighter spaces, the very least an economy passenger should receive is an average sized snack-not a teeny mini one."
1316,Offer something other than the same old waffle and biscuit.
1317,Snacks are appreciated.
1318,The dinner was served hot but salad as it should be was cold. Sandwich was served warm with melted cheese.
1319,We were not able to purchase due to not having the app.
1320,The tea was good and hot which was great because it was so cold.
1321,"As mentioned the coffee is awful, a coffee lover so happy to help taste test better alternatives."
1322,"I was happy to see a little more variety in the pre-flight meal selections, although this was only breakfast. I the recent past, meals (especially lunch or dinner) seemed to be southwest or Mediterranean options, which are good, but not when traveling for me!. Something simple is better...chicken without spicy sauce, pasta or potatoes, rice, etc. without being to spicy..."
1323,They did not offer additional beverages during the flight which seemed odd for first class and a cross country flight.
1324,I prordered a meal for both my husband and me. He was recorded. Mine was not.
1325,Please have consistency in wine. 3 times I got different wines.
1326,Hope have sugar free snack for the further flight trip .
1327,Presentation was not very upscale - fruit choice of watermelon and dried cranberries was odd like out of the bargain basement. Main course size was good and it was appreciated to have a hot meal on a dinner time flight over 2 hours in length but the plate served seemed cheap. No salad or appetizer was odd.
1328,More.
1329,Ordered the Belgian waffle. There was sugar sprinkled on top. It was a bit too sugary.
1330,First class food was not good.
1331,no.
1332,Take cash or credit on plane.
1333,no.
1334,Diabetic so the choices were not very good options.
1335,I did not like the fact that the flight attendant opens the can of pop and just pours you a cup instead of giving you the whole can. I am not a child.
1336,Wish could be more to choose from.
1337,Not enough snack options. Small portions for a 5 hours am flight.
1338,It was a red eye flight. Why did you turn the lights on 1.5 hours before landing to serve a ‘breakfast yogurt’?. That was NOT necessary.
1339,complimentary beverages were limited. I do not even remember even being offered snacks. The entire service was rushed.
1340,Appreciated the complimentary meal even though the chicken was very dry and bland. Better than getting nothing though for sure!.
1341,You need to have a fish alternative entree on the first class menu.
1342,Had what we wanted!.
1343,Great variety of choices.
1344,Chicken pasta was ok.
1345,"The beverage options tend to have high fructose corn syrup as their sweetener. I welcome premium, non alcoholic beverages that are not sparkling (do not want gas in the air) and are not sweetened with high fructose corn syrup. Natural cranberry?. Non sweet ice tea?."
1346,"For over 4 hrs flight, there should have been proper meal."
1347,Good food. Very tasty and satisfying.
1348,missing tomato Juice.
1349,No.
1350,served late and could not finish due to time.
1351,Great selection. Coffee quality could be better.
1352,I would like the option of flavored water.
1353,Very limited selection of food and beverages.
1354,It was on the day of the Queen's funeral. the amount of food on board was limited. It would have been nice to have had notice of this before-hand so that we could have bought something in the airport.
1355,"I was pleasantly surprised to receive full-size beverages. However, the meals were not very appetizing."
1356,Meat.
1357,"Overall, the wine selections need to be improved. Love that United serves bourbon <🥃>."
1358,Really need to step up the food selections. Please stop blaming COVID. Time to retrun to the old First class food services.
1359,i mixed the fruit juice with rum. it was more than twice as good as either alone.
1360,the food was just ok but plenty portion. I did not have the arrival meal coming into Dulles.
1361,No.
1362,The Impossible meat option was delicious!.
1363,"United should offer the option of a nice salad, soup and selection of cheeses served at room temp/crackers."
1364,There was no complementary food. A cookie or snack would have been nice.
1365,Not as tasty as expected.
1366,"I know my flights were short, and I know it is hard to deal with the many allergies that people have, but .. it would go a LONG way in general attitude of passengers if you would offer a small snack. A cookie, pretzels, .. does not have to be much. I just think it would improve the overall satisfaction and be well worth the effort."
1367,Too much eggplant in vegetable dish.
1368,No.
1369,Coffee was very good.
1370,was not offered any.
1371,agua.
1372,My 2 cents - you are doing everything anyone is doing so that does not set you apart. Consider a change - offer a prepackaged meal for free or for low price or something.
1373,good quality.
1374,Awesome.
1375,I was hoping for the brunch/breakfast selection on the early flight time (9:45 am departure).
1376,Nope.
1377,None at this time. It was a short flight.
1378,Need a premium wine selection for an up charge option.
1379,No.
1380,"They used to give you some kind of snacks, now its just drinks. people deserve a little more for their money."
1381,Having a better quality and variety of food and drinks.
1382,Sparkling water was good.
1383,Food not spectacular but adequate.
1384,I love it that you offer vegetarian/vegan meals.
1385,I like iced tea. none was available. Every supermarket carries it.
1386,Add some Veg options and customize based on flight routes and destinations.
1387,No.
1388,Choice of box snacks were limited. Surprised there was no burger or a similar hot meal to purchase on this 10 hour flight.
1389,Some time since we last flew United on this route. Considered that food had got better.
1390,Turkey and cheese sandwich is not good. I have had this for decades get a better idea!.
1391,"Hey United, love you, so some heart to heart feedback... I thought I was ""paying extra for"" the business / Polaris class ice cream sundae cart!. And I miss it!. It was your brand. Post Covid it has disappeared. It was missing my Houston London round-trip back in April-May 2020 also. United has lost something by losing the ice cream cart. Did some cost accountant make the call?. My hypothesis is deleting the ice cream cart is the wrong business value / branding decision. Context:. 1. A 1998 Harvard Business Review article on the turnaround of Continental gave a credo that the airline would provide whatever ""... the customer in Seat 9C ... would pay extra for."". Well for our African safari trip I was willing to pay out of my pocket - not corporate expense account - for seats 3F and 3L for my wife and me. And I had two flights where my experience was interrupted with the nagging thought, ""Dang, $22,000 and no frigging ice cream sundae service. What are they thinking?"". Reference: Right Away and All at Once: How We Saved Continental (hbr.org). https://hbr.org/1998/09/right-away-and-all-at-once-how-we-saved-continental. 2. I have been taking Continental / United business class since the 1990s, sometimes opting it over Singapore Airlines. I am Million Miles plus. For personal vacation travel I have bought ""business"" seats for my wife and me to Beijing in 2019 and London this year in addition to this trip Houston-Newark-Johannesburg-Frankfurt-Munich-Houston. 3. The sundae was not that expensive yet something I have always looked forward to on United (and previously Continental) long haul business flights. And while a little staff-time intensive, it provided good interaction staff-customer interaction and built for me brand goodwill. 4. Surprisingly the premade chocolate sundae tasted decent on this flight and did in many aspects hit the spot. It was a good portion. And in the day I did always skip the nuts and cherry. So are you wondering if the premade sundae of vanilla ice cream with cold fudge (no whipped cream) was nice enough why bother with giving this feedback?. Think of it this way... Post Covid people want a return to normalcy. Bringing back the ice cream sundae cart would be a great way for United to reassure their core customers that things are normal back in the Friendly Skies... serving up what the customer in seat 9C will ""pay extra for.""."
1392,Poor variety.
1393,NEED MORE DRINK VARIETIES.
1394,I had red wine and was satisfied.
1395,Turbulence in the first hour of the flight put pressure on the attendants to rush the meal.
1396,Pretzels were stale.
1397,It would have been nice to provide a small snack (even crackers or pretzels). All that was served was a beverage.
1398,Too quickly presented. Also on a 16 hour flight the attendants should check on refills frequently.
1399,I would like decaf tea available and also sweet tea.
1400,It was the same options as I had from SFO to CDG in May. You need to vary the options so it is not always the same. I was quite surprised it was the exact same choice. And the food was barely room temperature.
1401,"Pasta was ok. The salad small amount of lettuce accompanied with corn, carrots and something else was not edible. One hour before we were to land We were offered a turkey and cheese sandwich which was just ok."
1402,"Chocolate,cookies More sweets items."
1403,N/A.
1404,Nice that a meal was provided and free drinks.
1405,Good definitely could have been more appetizing.
1406,Na.
1407,Wish there had been a little more than the waffle cookie. I know it was a short flight but thought for first class there might have been also a second item such as trail mix.
1408,It took a long time to receive a drink on a 4 hour flight. There has to be a quicker way to receive a drink.
1409,I think beverages should have been offered more frequently.
1410,My spouse said the chicken entree was tasteless. she ate only a small portion.
1411,They came through only once and that was it!!!. It was a 5 hour flight!!!!!!!.
1412,The coffee it is awful.
1413,Lack of choices in snacks…on par with other airlines.
1414,More water next time - long flight!.
1415,No.
1416,Food quality not a first class experience relative to other airlines.
1417,I think United should hand out at least pretzels or something. Every other airline we fly does.
1418,The food could improve.
1419,I meant to also put food. The quality of the food is low.
1420,"We pre-ordered the burgers, which were very tasty. We did this because we have been on multiple United flights in September and did not care for the two options on the September 1st Class menu (Za'tar chicken - too salty and dry) and impossible meatballs (better, but not very interesting)."
1421,Perhaps a better variety of meals. The breakfast was good. the lunch only had 2 choices. Chicken or vegan.
1422,I was pleasantly surprised at the snack options for first class passengers on a 25-minute flight. Thank you!.
1423,"I was not offered a beverage on this flight. They did make an announcement that only one alcoholic drink per person would be served. ,, which is the first time in my life I have heard that announcement."
1424,No.
1425,Excellent. Food was enough and actually tasted good unlike other airlines. I was pleasantly surprised.
1426,I always order a bourbon and ginger ale on my United flights. I was surprised that the flight did not have any bourbon. instead I was offered Jack Daniels Whiskey. The drink was ok. I would have preferred Buffalo Bourbon.
1427,"Although, not sitting in first class, I was able to get a Takeoff box in main/economy cabin."
1428,Taste of food.
1429,"It is not a big deal, but I kinda missed the salty snack <:-)>."
1430,Why were we not served a meal on this flight?.
1431,I was surprised that there was not a meal provided on a 5 hour flight. Given that many people did not fly during Covid and this is a change I think I would market this. I would also give a protein as an option for a snack and not just carbs.
1432,No snacks offered after many years only flying united and only united this was the first time we did not get snacks was it because of the pandemic cutting costs ?.
1433,"When you ran out of complimentary snacks, the flight attendant brought us a complimentary tapas box. That was nice. should have enough complimentary snacks so everyone on board can have 1 or 2. 1 is not enough in those little packs."
1434,only water offered.
1435,I do not think it is unreasonable that the airline would consider to provide pretzels or cookies or something. There was no food service available on this flight. I think at least a cookie would be a nice idea.
1436,"There should be a selection of snacks, not just one option."
1437,No.
1438,No.
1439,More variety.
1440,"We did not have a choice of complimentary snack;. it would have been nice if we did. However, it really was not a big deal to me."
1441,WE actually had a choice on the flight home. On the flight to we had no choice and was not eatable.
1442,They did not have it available so I had to have something else.
1443,Diferentes galletas dulces y saladas.
1444,No.
1445,you just have to add a little food often you go back quickly you do not have time to eat so just croissants or something heavy.
1446,"Although it was delicious, it was not a very healthy meal, and there was no other option."
1447,nope.
1448,more selections please.
1449,No.
1450,I wanted to drink another drink.
1451,Perhaps more snacks to choose from.
1452,"Not the flight, but as mileage plus member have passes to access United club. the Denver club for most of the year has a temporary club for single pass users. The selection of items is very limited. the physical space leaves a lot to be desired. After using the temporary space once, have decided to skip it all together for our subsequent flights. Just seems the supposed benefit for mileage plus members is not a benefit at all. Our passes will expire - would be nice to extend expiration as United did for miles during Covid."
1453,Would have liked more diet soda choices.
1454,Snack was appreciated.
1455,out of cranberry juice and apple juice.
1456,Chicken meal was served with couscous - basically the same taste/ingredients as the salad. Strange combination. The dinner roll was cold and not that fresh - but an improvement from old stone-hard/stone-cold roll of a few years ago.
1457,They usually hand out Biscoffs but not this flight.
1458,No.
1459,I would like to see 100% vegan options and plant based milk for coffee as an option.
1460,I purchased a boxed snack before the flight and learned I needed to ask for it during the beverage service. The cabin staff did get it for me at the end of the flight and now I know when to ask for it.
1461,"The chicken was VERY DRY, making it difficult to eat/swallow. Otherwise everything was good."
1462,"During lunch time in a flight of 3 hours duration, should offer a sandwich. I just received a snack Pretzel which is not enough."
1463,Improve.
1464,On this flight we were not offered any food or beverages.
1465,no.
1466,"Bring more options for gluten free please. Many people are gluten free wether they have celiac , symptom or just do not want to eat bread . Example gluten free crackers . More cheese options and in cheese and crackers. Quinoa is another option ( cous cous is gluten ) thank you."
1467,Would be nice a Bagel or Muffin.
1468,They had a snack bar. The cheese plate was awesome.
1469,We should get free snacks instead of a cookie.
1470,a little dry but overall ok.
1471,A cheese platter and cornflakes is not exactly a good breakfast meal for an adul especially on business class. There were not other options either.
1472,Liked the variety.
1473,On a 14 hr flight I do not understand why you serve food about an hour after take off and about an hour before landing....... What are we supposed to do the 12 hours in between?.
1474,I thought the mid-flight snack should be more substantial on a 15 hr. flight.
1475,No.
1476,Enjoy the whole meal and portion size.
1477,Small portions for 5hrs flight.
1478,F&B was average No meal seevice from SF to Hi Wish you serve sandwiches.
1479,For food the only options were the chicken or vegetarian. The chicken was just OK. The broccolini was very good. There was too much rice served with this meal. I do not really need the hot rice side accompaniment along with a two scoops of a cold rice side. I would have preferred a salad rather than the cold rice. There was also rice with breakfast.
1480,"The only choices for dinner on United First were chicken or a soy dish. Usually there are three choices ex: chicken, beef or vegetarian."
1481,I was told there were two food options to pick from. only one was available when I gave my preference just a moment later. This happened for all meals. I upgraded to seats with alcoholic beverages included and only received 2 drinks on an 8 hour flight.
1482,No.
1483,"Coffee was available in flight, which is seldom. I understand that things happen."
1484,"No bottled water was offered at all. They said none on board. The food was mediocre at best, and awful at worst. Very limited variety of both food choices and spirits. Not top shelf spirits at all. You would think Polaris class would at least have top shelf spirits."
1485,"This was a special purchase of first class polaris for the family, and United ruined it, leaving me with crying wife and children."
1486,No.
1487,Please provide vegan options. Very easy to do. Thanks.
1488,The pasta was very heavy so I wish there was more vegetables to offset the heaviness.
1489,"I think it is ridiculous to serve ""dinner"" hours after normal dinnertime, when people would have already eaten hours before the flight. Who eats dinner after midnight?. It is a waste of food and money."
1490,no.
1491,The kosher meals we ordered - both of them - were very good. The hot portion was especially good (especially the first/meat meal) and the cold portions were standard to good. And there was an additional snack/sandwich which was very nice. Overall very much appreciated!.
1492,Forgot to serve me a beverage during breakfast service.
1493,Not available. Very short flight.
1494,The chicken on the chicken entrée was very dry and tough. Very difficult to cut with the utensils given.
1495,Tasted better than some restaurants I have gone to. Food was wonderful.
1496,Todo.
1497,Unhappy that they only had vegetarian option in first class. I did not care for it (but luckily I had food in the united club.
1498,They would not take my credit card. It had to be pre-registered. Small amount of beverage.
1499,A drink should contain much more drink than ice cubes.
1500,No appetizer served. Arrival meal had two plates of fruit and a packaged dessert. Wrong menus loaded on flight.
1501,"Missed the snack/cookie. Otherwise, Flight Attendants were great. I only drink water that is no problem. I can always bring my own cookie/snack. The flight is so short really do not need a snack anyway. Thanks for listening. I am a very satisfied customer. I do not fly often, always been feel safe."
1502,"No, I was guite satisfied."
1503,"Please stop offering that awful waffle. It is pure sugar, carbohydrate and chemicals. I feel like you are offering poison!. I was given one with pretzels in a bag and threw it away. Any other option would be better."
1504,"We had flown on Aug. 26 from Columbus to Calgary, Alberta. The breakfast selection was delicious. The meals on our return from Vancouver were mediocre."
1505,"Chicken was okay, dry. I ate cause very hungry since no time due to above issue."
1506,n/a.
1507,It would be nicer if United had more of variety of food options. It seems like we are barely making our connection flights and have no time to buy food at the airport. It would be nice if United had more food options. More filling. Also healthier options would be nice.
1508,"The bottom line is I wish you would improve the food. And, the wine was not a very good quality."
1509,Really enjoyed the meal.
1510,Maybe change to nuts or cheese and crackers.
1511,"A small sandwich snack was provided shortly before arrival. It was pretty bad. The bread was dried out and tough, only 1 thin piece of meat."
1512,"We thought since the flight was to Dublin, that Jameson or some other type of Irish whiskey would be on board. We were a little disappointed that it was not."
1513,The chicken was bland and hard since it was cold. It would have been better to precut the chicken and provide a salad dressing. The quinoa was not tasty.
1514,"Great service, staff was great and overall an enjoyable experience."
1515,hummus and pita bread.
1516,There was no snacks. I would have liked a snack.
1517,"I am not a big drinker. The F/A's only offered wine once after serving the meal. They did not offer water, I asked for it during the initial beverage service which they conduct concurrently with the meal service. SJU-EWR is a long enough flight that there should be a beverage service before the meal service. There was some turbulence but not at the level that prohibited service at normal cruising altitude."
1518,No snack was offered. No pretzels or anything.
1519,No.
1520,Pretzel are date of expiration 08/17/22 Mco to Newark.
1521,Food is poor quality and needs improvement.
1522,The kosher food from newark to TLV from freshko was delicious. please use freshko for all kosher meals. ( from tlv to newark as well.).
1523,Only one choice for diet soda.
1524,I also receive free snackbox and wine as a 1k.
1525,Great service.
1526,There were no pretzels or cookies provided - just drinks.
1527,"I love that United gives you the can of soda, and makes a point to recycle it."
1528,No.
1529,The previous comment on the food was regarding the food on the Denver to LHR portion. One cookie was served on this flight.
1530,I was pleasantly surprised how good the food tasted. Wine choice was good. wine quality OK only but more than drinkable. An expresso machine would be nice in business class for coffee.
1531,Food from Italy was much better than food from USA. I flew first class to Europe and coach on the return. Return flight was far superior in taste and quality.
1532,Choice of Nuts.
1533,The meal selection and quality is subpar compare with business class offering of Asian Airliners.
1534,I would love to see Pinot Gris carried and/or Tempranillo as additional wine varietals.
1535,It looked like she was handing us a pretzel n a cookie. She snatched back the pretzel like we were stealing her last dollar. It appears that you are pennie wise n pound foolish. Why would u leave a bad impression for 15 cents of food. Watch the old school give them the pickle.
1536,Chicken was in a spicy sauce. had to be cut up to eat. Not easy on a plane.
1537,Improve the food quality and taste.
1538,Excelent.
1539,No.
1540,"I expected a much better meal from business class. The meal on this flight was disappointing in taste, quality, and presentation."
1541,you they had no Fruit Plates that were offered in previous ads. The attendant said they always get calls for them but they hardly ever get them on board.
1542,I could not pay for my drink because I did not have the app. My seat mate ended up paying for it. Nice guy!.
1543,Delicious cookie!.
1544,Bien.
1545,I very happy.
1546,Chicken thai was okay. I have had better premium plus meals.
1547,They were perfect!.
1548,"Pretzels or cookie were offered, I chose pretzels, they were stale and lacked taste I am guessing they were OLD!."
1549,"For the length of the flight I was surprised I was not offered the can of Aha instead of just a glass, especially being 1K."
1550,N/A.
1551,They should pass with the beverages at least one more time.
1552,I was not given notice of when or how I could book a meal for specific dietary requirements.
1553,snacks were not large portions. there was no gluten free options.
1554,GREAT cup of tea. I ordered a second which I do not normally do.
1555,More options and better taste.
1556,Use larger cups.
1557,PLease add helthy options to the snacks you offer.
1558,No beers.
1559,I found a vegetarian meatballs were terrific.
1560,It would have been nice on such a long flight to been offered a snack toward the end.
1561,Short flight no service.
1562,Everything was excellent.
1563,"They could change it up;. they or either Southwest Airlines had warm baked cookies, served also peanuts. But most of all find something to keep people happy on their trip."
1564,None.
1565,Would have really appreciated a snack as it was early and there was no time to get breakfast with the packed airport.
1566,So much plastic!.
1567,"Because we were delayed for over 2 hours, I felt like you should have provided ALL customers with the same services as first class. Not too much to ask for given the stress and inconvenience you caused."
1568,How about Pepsi instead of coke!.
1569,A healthier menu if applicable.
1570,Everything was great. I was very happy with the French Toast. I think it may replace the scrambled eggs with ham as my personal favorite.
1571,The stewardess was very thoughtful and gave us soda. We had a very tight connection from Seattle due to the plane leaving late. The escort got us there in time. We had a person in a wheelchair. he provided great service to get us from one terminal to the next in time.
1572,Only one beer available.
1573,"No snack choice COUlD be more variety and more of it 4 hrs travel/etc to board, 4 hrs in flight!!. 8 hrs and 2 small cookies/juice?."
1574,No. I wanted to share feedback on meal from Heathrow to Chicago. The meal was not good.
1575,There was no milk/creamer for tea or coffee.
1576,There was a time we got warm chocolate chip cookies for a treat before we landed. I miss that.
1577,No.
1578,The breakfast has improved 1000% since that days of the poisonous cheese pocket. Thank you for stop trying to poison your first class passengers!. LOL.
1579,I had chosen the asian vegetarian meal. The main dish was: Rice and 2 Dhal varieties (Chole and another). My recommendation is: instead of 2 Dhal = only 1 Dhal and 1 Vegetable curry!. TNX.
1580,Please bring back the snack basket.....
1581,Customer should not have to pay for beverages or snacks.
1582,more extra food.
1583,Everything was warm. the brownie dessert was YUMMY. I personally did not care for the chicken dish. It was a bit spicy.
1584,Please give flight attendants details on contents of meal for food allergies. The lady sitting next to me(I sat on economy and gave my husband the business seat) had nut and pea food allergies and the flight attendant looked on their food sheet (for the economy food) And all it said was ‘vegetable lasagna’ and ‘green chicken curry’. Would be good to give your economy customers a little more info on food contents. As she was very dissatisfied with the lack of info.
1585,No items were available for purchase. beverages and complimentary small snacks were provided.
1586,"Nothing offered. I realize a short flight, but not even water or crackers?. You flights are not CHEAP!."
1587,"On a nine hour flight departing at 9:25, the main meal should be lunch, not breakfast. Make a Hawaii flight special. Differentiate UA from competitors. Offer MaiTais for sale. Bring back Canadian whiskey, one of the market's hottest sellers."
1588,I have seen this before on other airlines. The bread offered with the meal had a expiration date of March 2023. That is a long time!. I prefer something fresher.
1589,No snacks or food in First class.
1590,Noting.
1591,I am okay with it.
1592,The flight attendant was incredible in that she sought me out in economy class and thanked me for my loyalty and being a million miler and 1K. I wished I got her name so you could reward her.
1593,provide whole can rather than pour cup.
1594,Please ensure that every passenger can choose between the two options.
1595,Would have liked an option of a cold cereal.
1596,No.
1597,No.
1598,No.
1599,"There were no gluten free options for complimentary snacks, and limited for purchasable ones."
1600,"Because of how short a flight it was, there was no food or snack offered. Which I understand because of the length of the flight."
1601,Would be nice if there was a for smaller appetites area I hate throwing food out.
1602,No.
1603,No.
1604,No.
1605,Very tasty.
1606,no.
1607,Bigger airplane.
1608,I did not care for the offered snacks. I do not eat sweets. there were no salty options.
1609,I wish local (California) craft beers were available.
1610,Give some snacks no charge!!!. for free!.
1611,It was very tasty.
1612,You could provide whisky.
1613,One bottle of water is too little for such a long flight. Extra water bottles should be available during flight.
1614,Airplane food....
1615,"The only water available was Dasani water beverage. This is not water. It is a salted beverage. If one reads the label, it discloses it is ingredients as a form of salt and other additives. It is a beverage product of Coca Cola. Dasani does not claim to be water. if the label is read thoroughly. This may help clarify it is not water, but a salted beverage. Ideally, water that is unfluoridated (a neurotoxin), filtered (reverse osmosis) with a Ph of 7 (neutral pH) is best. There are many water options such as Aquafina, Kirkland, Crystal Geyser, and nice Spring Waters. Is it possible to look into the quality of water that is to be offered on flights. Idealize that many people do not realize Dasani is not labelled as water. But given that long flights can be very dehydrating, and many people wish to avoid unnecessary salts and high fructose corn syrup for health reasons, i may be something worthwhile to look into as part of your inflight service. Would it be possible to have pure water and coffee/tea be made from pure water on future flights?. Thank you so much for your consideration, I do enjoy flying on your airlines."
1616,The Brioche hamburger was terrible. All bread and no taste. At least I tg wasnicd and hot.
1617,i do not think we should pay for non alcoholic bevs.
1618,No. Just no food service on flight from Wichita to Denver.
1619,No.
1620,No.
1621,A free snack like Southwest or Delta would be nice. It makes an impression.
1622,Just beverages offered no food.
1623,Add additional free snack options.
1624,Vegetables looked overheated.
1625,"No, snacks were stale once thawed."
1626,No.
1627,The wine was very “cheap”. The ice cream dessert melted b4 I could eat it [wine]. Then “snacks” consisting of thick bread and cheese - served HOT- were served - made no sense.
1628,"It was not just my flight to Vegas as I have also been flying internationally to London. Overall, the food remains a step down from what it was prior to covid as well as in comparison to international competitors. It is the one area that could use improvement."
1629,Get a different pretzel brand. They were terrible. The cookies and waffles are great.
1630,I am happy with the food choices. I wish United would offer salad preferences as I am in a diet.
1631,For flights of this length there should be better purchase options beyond the snack boxes if the flights are during meal hours.
1632,no.
1633,"No, that is it!."
1634,My biggest issue is the amount of plastic that is used. I actually had my own water bottle which I would have preferred to have refilled. I also would have preferred to reuse my cup. This was not possible.
1635,Great to have flavored soda water on flights. Maybe serve hot tea plain and let guests put milk in it instead of serving white tea.
1636,"On these long flights it would be really appreciated if there could be more frequent opportunities to have some water. As you know, dehydration is a significant issue on long flights. This is really a health and safety issue in addition to a customer comfort issue."
1637,"more choices...including for purchase a previous flight had only water and coffee and tea, because ""it was a short flight""."
1638,I could not purchase beer or wine because I did not have my credit card on file with you. This is a bad policy!!!!!.
1639,"I know it is tough to fly with produce, but some healthy options would be great."
1640,You need to coordinate the menu. Bread and cookies do not go with all entrees - surprise surprise. The side dishes should be matched to the entree.
1641,No food or drinks because 1 hr flight.
1642,Not offered at all.
1643,No.
1644,Would be good to have a snack box available in first class on even short flights. There was not one available on this flight. I asked the flight attendant. ORD to GRR.
1645,too small.
1646,A little more selection. They were out of most everything.
1647,ability to order from app.
1648,the choice of meal is inconsistant ...to my taste especially breakfasts. I think improvement in the area is needed.
1649,More gluten free snacks.
1650,No.
1651,two pack would be perfect.
1652,Food etc was excellent;. good choices.
1653,...
1654,"No special meal was provided,because my name was not in there list!."
1655,Nice big can!.
1656,I was not offered anything.
1657,The beer selection was poor. I am a bit of a beer snob. Michelob Ultra is not beer...
1658,No swoopwAffels.
1659,It was excellent in every way <:)>.
1660,serve a snack.
1661,I am very disappointed that you discontinued the gluten-free snack box. I always depended on that. Almost none of your other offerings work for gluten-sensitive people.
1662,The meatballs with the pasta was delicious ;. however they ran out of wine!!. Could not believe it.
1663,No fresh food choices on plane. Wish the snack box choices would change more often.
1664,good food.
1665,A better variety of food/snack should be offer in flights of more than 2 hrs.
1666,Broccolini was terribly overcooked.
1667,Short ribs were not a great consistency. Hot fudge sundae could have been thawed before serving. The whole dessert was like a rock. hot fudge was frozen. Also miss the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies you served in business class in the past!.
1668,Variety snacks.
1669,No.
1670,Not offer.
1671,More snack options would be good. Due to allergies snacks provided are not an option.
1672,no.
1673,No.
1674,You could serv some snaks.
1675,A sandwich would be nice.
1676,limited wine options - even for premium economy. Expected more. Dessert was Ice Cream and served with the meal - so was melted by completion of the main course. Salad had dressing included.
1677,"Unfortunately did not receive first choice, and was not really interested in the remaining options."
1678,"First, for the cost of flying passengers should receive healthy free options. Everything has large amounts of salt. which is not good for you and makes your ankles swell."
1679,The snacks are only mediocre. They are all high carb flour and sugar.
1680,Why is milk served with coffee?. Even powdered creamer is better.
1681,sparkling wine.
1682,Not at this time.
1683,No.
1684,Good was good.
1685,No.
1686,"Just that the curry vegetable was delicious, just not enough of it to feel full."
1687,"For us diabetic customers, I would like more diet choices like diet sprite, diet 7UP, non caffeine not just diet coke."
1688,I selected the Pringle's but that was not a choice offered on the previous screen.
1689,- for flights over 2 hours it would be nice for flight attendants to 'automatically' provide the full can of soda (as they do with juice);. they do if I ask...
1690,Na.
1691,No food or beverage service…short flight.
1692,Should be more than 1.
1693,No.
1694,Meal selection is too limited. Faux meatballs does not sound apetizing.
1695,Not sure what the drinks cost yet but it was probably a lot.
1696,You need a secondary beer selection.
1697,The special meal was served way before the others. I do not like the feeling of eating long before others get their food. Less separation in time would be preferable.
1698,The choices at business class are becoming outdated and not clearly visible. I wish there was a list of different Wines or Spirit/beer (including) be made available like the food menu. It is hard to open the dirty hemisphere magazine and find the same economy class options listed there.
1699,Not much variety and not enough to eat on a long haul flight.
1700,Breakfast did not offer anything other than yogurt internet said would be egg breakfast.
1701,More.
1702,Good.
1703,No.
1704,Overall ok.
1705,I noticed several passengers not eating the chicken & rice!.
1706,The flight did not offer Tappas boxes. They did not have any on that flight and apologized. I want options!.
1707,Gluten-free snack option.
1708,This flight staff kept offering water throughout the flight. which not all of them do. Thank you!.
1709,A better selection of wines would be appreciated. Also more than one beverage service given the length of the flight.
1710,the service was good. on the outbound from SFO to LIH - there was a minimal amount of champagne/prosecco for an am flight - disappointed.
1711,"Snacks were only salty pretzels and sugary cookies, nothing healthy."
1712,Very happy the snack boxes are available.
1713,"Have something that travels better, like a sandwich."
1714,I would like to see more options available for food/snacks. The snack boxes combinations could definitely be improved. Please add plain club soda and Dole Pineapple juice!.
1715,A choice would have been nice. Only pretzels.
1716,"Breakfast, only yohurt vanille was served."
1717,"No, I am satisfied."
1718,I was traveling Business do I got a meal. It was good.
1719,On a 5 hour morning flight—you think you could spare a complimentary muffin or bagel for Pete's sake?.
1720,"I wish they still gave complimentary bags of snacks (pretzels, peanuts, chips, etc)."
1721,Nothing.
1722,Delicious.
1723,Ordered ahead of time and they have it ready for me.
1724,Be nice enough got it.
1725,there was none b/c all 3 bathrooms did not work.
1726,Upgrade the wine please for first class.
1727,Flights over an hour should include at least a complimentary snack (pretzels/peanuts).
1728,Not really.
1729,"I am always perplexed why we have to give a second choice. Why not ask our choice at check-in then provide enough of that choice on the flight. In this case, I did get my first choice, but that does not always happen."
1730,I have gluten food was not good.
1731,would have liked the overnight oats option.
1732,Small pack of peanuts.
1733,No.
1734,Offering Stella and Michelob as the only two beer options for a flight out of Germany is awful. I mostly drank water due to the beer choices.
1735,They were out of Chardonnay. Had Pinot Grigio instead but prefer the Chard.
1736,"Flight attendant cam thru with a handful (literally, her hand was full) of two choices - Biscoff cookies or a skimpy bag of pretzels. United can do better with offering more of a variety (3-5 options)."
1737,"It would be nice if you serve a little more than one cup of soda, but was ok."
1738,did not serve due to a short flight and turbulence.
1739,"Polaris food FAIR…. ice cream took over an hour to soften up.. ,take it off the menu!. Food too salty."
1740,more complimetary snack options?.
1741,Was not able to obtain a meal/snack. Only a breakfast box even though our flight ended in early afternoon.
1742,Nothing.
1743,I wanted to preorder special meals but did not see that as an option. The meals or the snacks are limited in choices.
1744,The food was not served warm and was too salty.
1745,Morning Food service to Athens. Greece was dreadful. We got no choice. I did not preselect anything because I thought we had an option to purchase diring flight. at least during dinner we had a choice.
1746,Not as tasty as on other flights.
1747,Choices were horrible.
1748,To small of a portion.
1749,"You show Burger Bistro on the menu but was not available. I think a flight between 12-3pm should have options like the Bistro since its around lunch time. The Tapas boxes do not cut it for me, they are good as snacks."
1750,The coffee was great.
1751,WE did not get to purchase food as they ran out after we were not asked....
1752,No.
1753,Everyone wanted the pasta option. there was no other option available by the time my row was reached.
1754,I would love to have almond/coconut milk on flight if possible.
1755,Pretzel bags SO small.
1756,Please be sure to have vegan options.
1757,Too little.
1758,I would love it if you starting offering Dr. Pepper.
1759,"Not really, overall very satisfied!."
1760,"There were no stroopwaffels catered, which was disappointing. Those are the best for morning flights."
1761,Nice breakfast for the flight.
1762,Diet Dr Pepper would be great!!.
1763,Really impressive and pleased there was a vegetarian option.
1764,Breakfast on the way back home was very ordinary( egg dish) and tea did not taste like tea at all. But that is only my opinion. I did not starve so all ok.
1765,Coffee was bad.
1766,Everything was good.
1767,No.
1768,I love having vegan options. Thank you!.
1769,No.
1770,They need to upgrade the menu.
1771,We are not usually offered more than one drink. in this flight we were Thank you. small gestures like this make a big difference.
1772,No.
1773,"Up the quality of your beverage service, especially if you are in first class. Your selection is sub par at best."
1774,"Ice cream was molten, a more simple sandwich would have been better."
1775,Please change out the same chicken you have been offering for at least two months & the meatballs which I believe has been offered for approximately three months - get some variety as I used to enjoy the food options.
1776,"The flight attendants did not mention that we could purchase those meals at all, only drinks. I had to request to buy one."
1777,"the meal I wanted was run out, so I had no option. bread is cold. meal is not that tasty."
1778,Coffee tasted great.
1779,"We were served a sandwich ( no choice of kind) at end of flight, but nothing to drink because a beverage cart had turned over. It seemed they could have handed out bottles of water or cans of drinks without a cart."
1780,"Flying from San Francisco to Portland in economy, we had a snack (a cookie or biscuit) so I was surprised on this flight from Portland to San Francisco in First Class that nothing was available."
1781,No.
1782,No Snacks.
1783,"More variety, unlimited amount."
1784,More choices.
1785,Please serve some snacks during the trip.
1786,Not of fan of the snacks but understand the restrictions with peanuts.
1787,Would like to see more than one diet pop.
1788,Food quantities could be improved.
1789,"Great service, my came out of the restroom. she was offered a drink."
1790,A complimentary snack would go along way to make folks feel valued.
1791,The best.
1792,Presentation of food was not particularly appealing for business class. There was no appetizer which is still done post Covid on American.
1793,Very good meal and breakfast sandwich. Salad with meal was just ok.
1794,No.
1795,typo.
1796,Love the Bischoff cookies.
1797,Nothing served. flight too short.
1798,Would be nice to provide snack.
1799,If you want to eat more a. Bigger meal you have to pay for the whole meal.
1800,Vegetarian options.
1801,"In general, there was no way for me to share my dietary restriction so was unable to eat the majority of the food on all of my flights."
1802,"On the Beer front I would like to see a bit more variety of selection, like a Kolsch beer or the Lagunitas Day Time IPA... its a light and very tasteful IPA."
1803,Co-ordination and timeliness could be better.
1804,You should look at some healthier options for the complimentary snack (e.g. pack of almonds...something that does not have sugar).
1805,Information I had received before flight said I was not able to use a card for inflight purchases which I find extremely inconvenient. I realize that apps are accepted. I find the concept of not taking cards onboard absurd.
1806,The red-eye meal was a welcome surprise but the chocolate filled mini pie dessert was not good.
1807,We were only offered water.
1808,The salad was not good and selection of red wine poor.
1809,Plastic cups could be larger.
1810,"food on this flight was ok. it was not ok on the flight from Frankfurt to Chicago. the choices were limited;. the hamburger and couscous dishes were really bad. the bun on the hamburger was rock hard. breakfast choice, not egg. was weird - all creamy stuff. Meals have been good in the past. the international chick option recently was excellent."
1811,"What was offered during the flight was good, maybe offer better food options for business class."
1812,The vegetarian choice of Tofu in Business Class was delicious. It is a great option to have.
1813,I think it is important to communicate in advance via app if passengers can expect a meal or not. It is never quite clear - perhaps simply advising the policy ?. Flights over xx hours will be served 1 meal .. or whatever the case may be. This way customer can plan.
1814,I was given the whole can with a cup of ice. Very nice.
1815,No.
1816,No cookies or crackers.
1817,Could of offered a bit more choices of snacks. Maybe something more substantial.
1818,I thought one of the better meals I have had on flight.
1819,Ensuring the people are in the correct seat when cards are on file and will be automatically charged.
1820,"these two flights had food that was a lot better than the food on my similar flights in March. However, your survey here really should have some middle option between like and dislike, since some of those questions kind of wanted that option. I have to admit I was not thrilled with my own food waste after getting an unwanted fruit salad as part of my selected cheeseburger lunch option..."
1821,Standard food/beverage of today's airlines.
1822,I asked for apple cranberry and was given cranberry.
1823,No.
1824,"Ok I had an aisle seat the food cart ran into my elbow which was left unnoticed. When drinks were being served the stewardess spilled orange juice all over over me , splashed over me and my shirt. She apologized and later gave me a snack box."
1825,The white wine offered on this flight was not so good.
1826,my fish entree was excellent!.
1827,No food.
1828,I preferred it when u could just ask for a drink instead of having to do it on website.
1829,Morning flight and mimosas were spot on.
1830,The waffle was soggy. the banana slices were nasty looking. I did not know what they were until I tasted the flavor on the waffle. The quiche my wife had did not taste good.
1831,Typically lousy coffee... not really hot...
1832,Bring back food serving for long flights over 5 hours to economy seating.
1833,None.
1834,Flight prices are very but do not provide any snack.
1835,"One issue I want to mention unrelated to this flight is that twice in the past year I have been charged for drinks that I did not purchase, but were likely from those in seats nearby. There is not a way of disputing these charges either."
1836,Not enough.
1837,Free beer.
1838,Same thing no changes.
1839,"Even on short haul business flights, there should be something other than the very basic snacks offered, a little sandwich or hot pizza pocket, etc would be much more appreciated."
1840,No snack?.
1841,Nothing.
1842,Very good.
1843,All good.
1844,Very small cup of soda.
1845,"Our pre order food was not given to us together with the snack wafer not until we asked for them. We were served right away. the problem was their system was not working. Maybe before flight system should be in good working condition. We were satisfied with our order, though."
1846,Need to give more food of some variety for A cross country flight.
1847,preorder was not offer to me before flight.
1848,no.
1849,"No, but on the flight from Brussels to Washington the remark of 1 glass of wine or beer made me feel like a alcoholic! <😂>. I was very happy I could obtain a second glass."
1850,No.
1851,You should reinstate free snacks.
1852,Mo.
1853,The pasta was delicious!.
1854,Flew first class- got one glass of Chardonnay with ice cubes. No snacks. No refills.
1855,Only had option for sweets nothing else for snack.
1856,better selection of snacks.... not everyone eat cookies and pretzels.
1857,N/A.
1858,No.
1859,Pls provid meal in lunch or dinner time if fl are more then 3/4 hrs.
1860,A little cookie is not a snack.
1861,Wish we could all do a better job of reducing plastic consumption.
1862,NA.
1863,"It was a quick flight, and I appreciate that there was no service. Things were quieter and less disruptive."
1864,I did not preorder food for this flight - there were ONLY 2 CHOICES - CHICKEN ZAATAR (HAD ON THE PREVIOUS FLIGHT TO SEATTLE) AND MEATLESS MEATBALLS - REALLY?????). PROVIDE OPTIONS UNITED.
1865,We will done.
1866,Offer al least water more often.
1867,They should give you the whole can.
1868,No.
1869,It was very good. Best ice cream for dessert!.
1870,I was unfamiliar with the process of food and drinks only going through an app beforehand. Was disappointed I could not get a beer on the flight to dc but I did not know. There were no snacks at all on that flight. No pretzels on the return flight.
1871,Loved the variety and the Stroopwaffel option!.
1872,All the meals were very nice!.
1873,Food preordered in f class was good and appropriately hot.
1874,Flavor was too strong for a midnight flight.
1875,consider passing out the snacks at the gate before boarding.
1876,None.
1877,Vegetarian option need to revisit by United choice of the food like okra paneer is there for years need to change also vegetarian also like to have a choice like meat <🥩> need the variety Naan Bread <🍞> was horrible temperature of the bread as well hardness was like you are eating chewing Gum. Very poor test.
1878,Please change your provider...it has not improved over the years...
1879,Not applicable as there were none on this short flight.
1880,Did not like this scotch. I was one of the worst ever. I usually have one or two. i did not even finish this drink.
1881,Alright.
1882,No.
1883,No.
1884,Just very bland.
1885,In first class I wish there was more food or snack options. I thought I would of had more options.
1886,I did not realise I could order a tapas snack prior to the snack. This is the first time I had flown United on an intl ticket. Regular passengers knew about it...it would have been a better choice.
1887,The aha water is an awesome addition.
1888,More varieties and halal meat.
1889,Felt offerings were sufficient and glad that flight attendants came through twice to offer beverages.
1890,Airline food was basic.
1891,It was so nice to get a whole can of ginger ale instead of just a splash or two of it with a full cup of ice.
1892,Give a small snack i had a connection flight with united and I barely made it!. Did not have the time to purchase anything at the airport!. I got only a coke can!.
1893,None offered.
1894,great service and food.
1895,Food and beverages were excellent in business class.
1896,Y.
1897,none.
1898,More options will be great.
1899,First Class snacks were simple and uninviting.
1900,We order kosher and was there and very tasty.
1901,I would like to see diet Dr pepper.
1902,We should be able to purchase and pay for the Food on the flught.
1903,"There were no snacks offered, only beverages."
1904,"I believe you need to go back to credit card usage. It is a bit complicated. specially if you are not booked using your MileagePlus. In fact, none of my purchases have been charged yet."
1905,I asked for the vodka separately from the Bloody Mary mix as I want just a tiny bit of it for flavor. It never came.
1906,"You can not expect much from an economy ticket food offering but as the old saying go ""what is up with Airplane food""."
1907,You need to step it up.
1908,Too. many carbs' starches—not enough healthy food choices.
1909,No.
1910,Loved the fact that I learned you serve my favorite brand of scotch on board. Glenfarclas. The only disappointing aspect is you only had three on board. I usually fly American and am seriously considering leaving them behind to fly United just so I can enjoy Glenfarclas while flying.
1911,"The flight attendant told me that she did not see any pre order for food. This was after she offered the meal I preordered to someone else. He told her he did not pre order it. When she got to me she said my choice was no longer available. Then she double checked and discovered that I had pre ordered the meal. The same thing happened with my wife's gluten free meal. She said she had no record of it. When she went back and checked, she said she did have it. The same thing happened on the previous flight. There is a problem with the accuracy of the pre order meal system."
1912,Need more Halal or veg options please.
1913,I scanned my passport but was not issued my boarding pass until I arrived at the airport. This caused me to lose my preselected seat and put me at the back the plane.
1914,No.
1915,It would have been better if they offer Keto Diet food.
1916,No!.
1917,Great variety. Healthy choices.
1918,I have no complaints re food/beverages. My complaint is that I was not able to go into the United Club (with my free pass) when I arrived in Denver. I had a 3 hour layover before I was to fly home. I was looking forward to being able to relax.
1919,They gave us pretzel. Nothing else.
1920,It would be nice to have a gluten free snack available even if I had to pre order and pay for it.
1921,Please offer Scotch and better wine.
1922,The red wines were just ok.
1923,good flight.
1924,Love the chocolate filled dessert.
1925,I felt the white wine was not a quality wine despite the fact that it was a New Zealand sauvignon blanc. They have very good white wines. this was not.
1926,"No wine selection, and the red was mediocre."
1927,I received a can of soda as opposed to a cup. I appreciated the can!.
1928,Nope.
1929,No.
1930,I would rather have an option for bottled water if can of water to use throughout the fight instead of waiting to be asked if I want seconds. The plastic cups are small.
1931,"Would like to see a broader range of snacks;. crackers and cheese, apple or carrot slices."
1932,No scotch.
1933,No.
1934,"The coffee was tasty, the soda refreshing. One suggestion - perhaps a cookie or biscuit could be added. A nice complement to a beverage. Thank you."
1935,great food!.
1936,No apple juice was available.
1937,Appreciated getting a full can of diet coke.
1938,"Need more cold beverages.. , need to offer potato chips."
1939,Same meals with flights.
1940,Better service than international sector of flight - very good overall.
1941,like the irish food.
1942,This was not a 1st class experince. I feel like the same snacks would be offered in coach.
1943,Offer simpler food options eg a cheese sandwich and fruit.
1944,More choices and bigger portions are needed.
1945,No food or drinks offered. That was the only negative of my flight.
1946,Everything was fine.
1947,As it was a short flight did not this service.
1948,No.
1949,Considerations should please ve made for those who do not eat cheese.
1950,There was no snack option. It was just the cookie. And no one came back asking if O wanted anything else.
1951,"The dinner choices were lamb, salmon, or vegetable curry. I had the curry because I do not eat lamb and I would never trust seafood to be cooked correctly from an airplane catering setup. The curry was spicy and did not sit well in my stomach. A pasta or rice dish in a different sauce would have been a more preferable vegetarian choice and a chicken dish would be better than a fish choice. For breakfast the only choice was steak and eggs. I skipped that because I do not eat beef. so I was left with a very small cup of fruit and a croissant. Those were good, just not enough. I was also told there was no black tea available when I asked about a breakfast blend. A cereal or yogurt offering would have been nice, as would something other than green tea for non coffee drinkers."
1952,6hours flights should include a free meal.
1953,No.
1954,"I always buy the Takeoff Box but it would be nice if more protein options were available and fresh fruit, not dried."
1955,No.
1956,It was adequate.
1957,Increase the food portion and specially on a 9 hr flight provide a second hot meal to economy passengers.
1958,La comida que nos dieron en la mañana fue poco satisfactoria.
1959,Food offerings can definitely improve for flight over 3 hours duration.
1960,Please add more American options. Most food was ethnic and high calorie fare.
1961,The fish was ok but a little mushy. The only dessert was Indian or ice cream. I wish there had been a fruit option.
1962,"Campari, or Aperol, or other light spirit."
1963,No food choice only chicken was available.
1964,No.
1965,NO.
1966,Not generous … people are dehydrated and you only serve once.
1967,The chicken was disappointing. The only other option was veggie meatballs.
1968,"Every option offered was high carbohydrate - bread, cous-cous, etc. I could only eat the artificial meatballs and the tow small pieces of broccoli and only about half of the fruit dish. But, I ordered this because the other options were worse."
1969,I think there should be 2 rounds of beverage service on a flight of this length.
1970,No.
1971,was not offered to coach customers.
1972,No beverage or food served on this short flight.
1973,Lunch pasta bland snack sandwich was very greasy.
1974,"Snack was cheese-covered pretzel sandwich. It was very, very greasy. oil dripped all over my pants. It was not healthy, not easy to eat, not easy to hold due to it being so greasy and messy. It was a very poor choice in opinion for an in-flight food item, which should be easy to hold, easy to eat, not messy, etc."
1975,The menu needs to be changed for breakfast in October. I have had enough egg whites and kale. Disgusting. My pastry around it was burnt.
1976,No.
1977,I would love to have options like sugar free juice or no sugar added juices and drinks. I would also love to be offered a meal that is not super spicy. All of the chicken dishes in the last year I have been offered are very spicy. I really get heartburn on flights from the spicy dishes. I think it would be nice to be offered meals without a lot of sugar and meals without a lot of spice. My daughter has IBS and those things make her bend over in discomfort after eating. Thank you for listening.
1978,Need bigger variety.
1979,No.
1980,The chicken was rubbery. I thought we were past the era of rubbery chicken in Biz class. Apparently. not.
1981,they were not offered unless we asked for them.
1982,Out of my four flights this express flight was the only one offered a snack. It was very welcomed. All of your flights should do the same.
1983,"Sat in first class and did not have a selection of meal, had to accept what they had left."
1984,Great service.
1985,I understand that you want to monetize food/beverage. Not a fan.
1986,no.
1987,No.
1988,"My comment does not have to do with United specifically, it is related to airport regulations. It is frustrating!. because there is no place where I was not able to get anything healthy or adequate for my husband who is diabetic."
1989,8.
1990,Good selections.
1991,Newark to Buffalo is a very short flight so obviously nothing is going to be served on that flight which makes sense. The United international flight to Italy going to Italy the food was absolutely awful coming back from Italy the pasta dish was much better than the I do not know what it tasted like curry on the way to Italy. The salads united should just ditch because nobody eats them they are so little and so bad.
1992,The prices were high.
1993,i agree with the contactless option but would prefer to pay cash.
1994,Peach or white grape juice and just fresh fruits (not in a combo but by themselves)would be nice.
1995,Unsure of what was available. Flight was super short. Tough for attendants to do much.
1996,Could use some type of snack pretzels cookies etc.
1997,The snacks are very tiny and not very filling.
1998,No.
1999,There was nothing wrong with the meal. variety seems to have vanished. I have had the same choices on several flights. There was no opportunity to pre-order for this flight.
2000,"They served us the wrong meal, but that was okay. It was actually more delicious than the Thai Curry we were supposed to get."
2001,I have had better cheeseburgers from 24 hour gas stations. Very poor quality.
2002,There lots of great chooses.
2003,It is was too salty. Too bad it could not have been fresh food on the flight. I do not mind cold food. Sandwich etc. but the salt. Too much.
2004,The bread in the burger served was very dry and hard. May a wrong heating procedure.
2005,"Need more diet soda options. Diet Dr Pepper, Diet Sprite, Diet Rootbeer."
2006,There was not any.
2007,Does not look good Maybe it is economic class.
2008,Excelente.
2009,"Try to serve real coffee, the ""American coffee"" is testless."
2010,"No, thanks."
2011,I like that you provide whole cans of soda.
2012,Should offer a free snack.
2013,"Got a flat ginger ale, but that is okay."
2014,I had read on Facebook how good the bananas foster was and it did not disappoint.
2015,"More options would be nice. Ir pretzel, cookie, wafer, trail mix."
2016,No.
2017,Bring back peanuts.
2018,The soda was warm and quickly melted the ice.
2019,Definitely lacking in any kind of premium snack.
2020,I wish my chicken entree portion was bigger. I was hungry after 2 hours.
2021,Pretzels did not taste fresh.
2022,Would like to have some cookies or nuts offered. No snacks offered on the flights.
2023,I did not care for the meal choices.
2024,I expect to receive to entire mini bottle. Premixing with Coke only 1/2 of the bottle is unacceptable.
2025,No.
2026,It is not fair for elderly people that have to get a United app in order to purchase food.
2027,Did not have a choice on snacks.
2028,please upgrade the menu to previous standards --- there are plenty of carnivores on the planet riding united planes....
2029,"We did not receive a snack!. I would not mention it, because we were so happy to be on the flight, it did not matter, but you solicited additional information."
2030,A snack and beverage would have been nice but because of turbulence they were unable to serve anything.
2031,No.
2032,All good.
2033,Prefer fresh fruit choices.
2034,none.
2035,ham/turkey and cheese sandwich was lacking (served before landing);. I am allergic to cheese.
2036,"I did not have a meal on this particular flight as I indicated;. they served snacks (pretzels and some kind of cookie), which were fine."
2037,There should be more snack variety.
2038,"This was a short flight where only beverage service was provided in first class. I appreciate how quickly the flight attendants provided our beverages in first class knowing how little time we had to consume our beverages, so that was great."
2039,very limited and some no choice on quality single malt scotch.
2040,Excellent...to me the food and drink were good but it was the sevice that went with it that made the experience that extra special. Keep doing it and thank you!!.
2041,What happened to the little bag of pretzels or other small snack with the beverage?.
2042,You can not even throw in a couple of cookies?. Sheesh.
2043,"Warm the food up, bread and meals are half frozen (and icecream for dessert, in a cold cabin after a cold meal...)."
2044,A small freebie snack would be nice. Pretzels or cookies.
2045,"It would be great to have better quality purchase food available. The cheese and crackers were fine, however the salad was not very good."
2046,No Snack was offered.
2047,None.
2048,A very good operation. Two very good meals. Above par.
2049,"For passengers flying business, the snacks are not adequate in the selections and portion size."
2050,I appreciated the PDB's served on my flights both to and from EWR.
2051,I do not know why you offered snacks at all considering how small the portions were. The coffee was terrible. The flight attended warned me when I ordered it that someone earlier had complained about the taste. They said they did not know what was wrong as they prepared it the same way they always did.
2052,"I have never had dinner on board a flight, so I have heard some airline food horror stories… well that was not the case at all. The food was exceptional, hot, fresh, and tasted fantastic."
2053,"Except for them I boarded, I had a bag and was asked “are you in first?”. Which I was. The overhead bins were filled with flight attendant or dead heading pilot bags."
2054,Suggesting 2 meals for a 7 hour flight.
2055,From Denver to Orlando the “Take off” box was good. But you were sold out of breakfast sandwiches within the first few rows.
2056,"As far as i know, there was no food or beverage service in this short flight."
2057,Gluten free option would have been nice since I could not eat the snack.
2058,Not enough.
2059,Chicken was tasteless and over cooked.
2060,No.
2061,"The meal I received was not the one I ordered, but it was good anyway. I did not know what beverages were available. I guess I could have asked. the flight attendant just asked what would I like to drink."
2062,Warm food if possible. Salad is too dry. Packaging and containers were easy to spill.
2063,After a 4 hour delay you served a tiny bag of dry pretzels what a slap in the face and the food voucher did not cover more than a bag of peanuts and drink…. Shame.
2064,no.
2065,Free.
2066,I purchased an Premium seat and it was a perfect experience!!!!!!!!.
2067,I liked that the vodka was made locally and not from a mass producer. I also liked that drinks were offered even on a short flight. I like ginger ale and that was available too.
2068,Poor food choices. bread was tough. Service took a long time.
2069,Sorbet was not frozen- still pleasant.
2070,Thank you.
2071,The food size should be bigger.
2072,Excellent service provided by flight attendant.
2073,No.
2074,I think snacks should still be offered to passengers.
2075,No.
2076,"Not the fault of the crew, they were only allowed to provide water by the captain."
2077,No.
2078,"why only Cutty Sark served on both international and domestic flights. On this flight the flight attettendant even mentioned she had only 2 bottles on board. Also when we sat down she through a bottle of water and a cookie in a bag on the consul. Paying over $5,000 round trip each, internationally. Not what your competitories do."
2079,miss the sundaes.
2080,Surpassed my expectations. Thank you.
2081,"Available food selection was very limited. The food and wine are priced right only because I get a discount from my United credit card. Otherwise, they are expensive."
2082,Making sure therenis enough selection for everyone.
2083,At a minimum snack and wine on short international flight as before.
2084,At a minimum a snack should be served as other airlines do. You were good at this in the past.
2085,"More vegan items please!. Cookies, chips or other snacks would be great."
2086,Oops I did not have wine that was on the London to DC flight.
2087,Muy bueno.
2088,it was fine.
2089,Coconut water.
2090,"It would be great if you could offer healthy option, like apple wedges. Thank you."
2091,"Display the allergy information. I should have asked, but was not sure if they would know. I would say easily display it, so we do not have to bother the flight attendants to dig for it."
2092,"I know it was a short flight. I was in first class and any beverage, even ice water, would have been nice. I do not recall receiving any beverage."
2093,Meal was ok but not great.
2094,Food could definitely be better. no one likes short ribs lol.
2095,I do not consume much carbs. there are no options for people with other types of diets.
2096,Not everything was good <👍🏿> thank you.
2097,Should get better wine.
2098,Maybe you will added the bread.
2099,Excellent.
2100,OK.
2101,None.
2102,Overall more than expected.
2103,The standard could be a little higher for the ticket price.
2104,Would prefer healthier juices without corn syrup.
2105,No.
2106,"The communications to pre-order snacks are irritating: the last thing I want to do is engage in a scrum with my fellow passengers due to limited snacks. Surely, United can accept the costs of having sufficient snacks on board to meet demand."
2107,Food and beverage was fine. the method to pay for snacks was overly complicated. You should be able to just hand a credit card for payment instead of the app payment set up. To complicated.
2108,They ran out of ginger ale so I was not able to get the can.
2109,"I saw that they offered the different kits. I overheard the flight attendant sell hamburgers. What else is available, I had no idea."
2110,Wonderful short ribs!.
2111,Even though water was offered the duration of the flight makes this N/A.
2112,It was a fairly short flight so we were pleased to have a good option like cheese nuts crumble cake..
2113,The only options given to us were water or orange juice. I do not like orange juice and not having another option was disappointing.
2114,The snack bags are not great.
2115,kosher ''fresco'' meals were very good.
2116,Food from Paris has better food quality.
2117,No.
2118,Love the auto payment feature.
2119,Since we were leaving Minneapolis i was hoping for some cheese curds!! <😃>.
2120,No other snacks provided.
2121,The first food I requested was not available.
2122,This flight served only a beverage and snack.
2123,The meal was not very good. Less than mediocre tasting.
2124,I would rather pay via credit card on the flight like u used to be able to do.
2125,"I have flown multiple flights from Chicago to Phoenix. I fly first class. Unfortunately, I have only been able to eat the same menu for a month."
2126,En realidad mi inconformidad no fue en el vuelo de Tokyo a los Ángeles es de los Ángeles a Houston que no hubo ni una sola comida y me parece que mi vuelo era bastante largo sería ideal recibir por lo menos un sándwich gracias por preguntar sobre mi experiencia con ustedes.
2127,I thought I read in your magazine that you gave us a snack and a beverage. We did not get a snack.
2128,Wine quality was not great.
2129,Okay.
2130,Short flight. Did not expect anything.
2131,"I was sleeping at the time they passed over, but never went back to ask me if I want anything."
2132,Very satisfied.
2133,was not crazy about your snacks for purchase.
2134,Very convenient.
2135,"Glad you have coke, makes a world of difference."
2136,Na.
2137,No.
2138,Deben de mejorar la alimentación.
2139,there was not any.
2140,No.
2141,Real food???.
2142,Would have liked a lite snack. Crackers or peanuts with the drink.
2143,The tray table did not have an indentation so I to hold the drink and put the beer can in the food box to keep from slipping.
2144,More vegetarian and vegan options would be welcomed. I heard a few people asked for this. there was nothing available.
2145,Is there consideration of adding tequila as a liquor option?.
2146,Pretty good coffee.
2147,I think the presentation. quality of the desserts was limited.
2148,"While I was aware of the necessity to store my credit card info on the website and/or get a QR code, I felt bad for the couple sitting next to me who did not speak English very well and were not able to purchase anything because they did not have their credit cards stored. Do not really know how to rectify this, but maybe more attention could be given to making this known to all passengers."
2149,An option for something other than pretzels would be nice.
2150,The attendants forgot to distribute the snack until the lady who sat next me ask for snack.
2151,Salad should not be served with the dressing on the bottom of the bowl. My original dessert (ice cream) was melted (soupy).
2152,The dinner was spicy I do not recommend.
2153,More snacks would be nice.
2154,"Use Singapore airlines as your guide and put some energy and creativity in the meal service. As I said, the bare minimum was offered, served and executed. I do expect more from a business class experience."
2155,No.
2156,Very short flight. We have beverages only. A snack would have been nice.
2157,Only had one option of the snack which was a very small size pretzel pack. The coffee was good. The smell on the pain made it difficult to eat.
2158,Our flight from Chicago to Maui served breakfast which was very early on in the flight. It seemed to me that a lunch would have been better. That was a long flight with the main meal so early on.
2159,"Please stop including that weird grain salad as a side. It is not a real salad, it taste like cold oatmeal, it is sad looking, and everyone knows it is filler."
2160,There was no food.
2161,First class food and beverage should have been better than what rest of plane had. There was also no drink offered after boarding.
2162,No.
2163,"Do not change my food order, while giving to another person only 2 seats away!!!!."
2164,They should add other snacks. Not a pretzel fan!.
2165,Did not have enough sodas.
2166,No.
2167,None was offered.
2168,Please offer canned tea for iced tea.
2169,Offered drinks a couple times. the flight attendant were friendly.
2170,The flight was fine. United should be embarrassed about the food served in the DFW United Club.
2171,"Different food, cookies and pretzels always."
2172,"The food selection remains the same chicken, beef, vegetables ... the taste is disappointing."
2173,It would be nice to have a real food option such as a fruit and cheese plate for sale rather than just snack boxes. It was a dinner hour flight.
2174,Already answered that I thought the Turkey sandwich was good but maybe a little more food should have been offered at that time as it would have been our dinner time.
2175,It would be great to receive the drinks first. We wait for quite a while with dry pretzels until the drink trolley arrives.
2176,no.
2177,how about photo chips.
2178,I did not have any.
2179,Very nice.
2180,The side dish tasted terrible.
2181,One of the better inflight meals I have had (Thai green curry chicken and rice).
2182,Wine was inferior taste (Chardonnay).
2183,"The GF offering of seafood was daring, and pulled off well. No fishy taste or smell. Great job. The filet was served medium rare, very nice."
2184,No.
2185,No.
2186,Sufficient!.
2187,"I am certain the crew got the other choice, Chicken. Why even serve meatballs. You are not a subway!!!."
2188,Some beverages were not available that were on the list.
2189,"The fish was very good. the side cold noodle was not tasty, almost no taste."
2190,No all was good.
2191,None.
2192,Two would be nice.
2193,Chicken dish was too spicy for me.
2194,No.
2195,There were no snacks. I was so looking forward to a stroopwafel.
2196,free foos should be better.
2197,Meal described as chicken and pasta. It was quinoa. which I do not care for. would have made a different choice if I had known. That said. the flavor was ok.
2198,Please fly JetBlue mint to see what is possible. I love you guys. the Newark to LA flight should be premium and feel special. And it does not in terms of the quality of food or drink. It used to prior to 2019.
2199,Ran out of German beer.
2200,Should be food not snack served.
2201,"The overall food quality in business does not live up to competition. Try LH or Swiss. I do not like that salad. main course are brought together. by the time one is done with the cold food. the hot food is medium warm. LH serves the main course separately. Why not on UA?. More work?. Oh my, you are up there for 9 hours, what is the issue?. The cheese is ridiculously bad, served with crackers in plastic wrap. Absurd. One sweet desert, the forever presented vanilla ice cream with chocolate fudge as if that is the only dessert in the entire world. My goodness UA, who designs your menu?."
2202,I did not have a charger port.
2203,"There are not enough options of actual food, not snacks, to purchase."
2204,Comfortable Flight.
2205,United's food offerings are improving. A little more improvement needed but overall United is doing well.
2206,Keep meals simple. I prefer a fresh sandwich over a cooked meal that tries to taste fresh.
2207,When I ask for a glass of wine I do not want to be turned down.
2208,Was good.
2209,love the can of sparkling water.
2210,Needed the sandwiches to buy.
2211,"Part of my entree were warm but part of it seem barely thawed. The flight attendants did not know what wine they were serving, better just ask for white or red. On long flights they should come through the cabin more frequently with beverages, even if it is just water."
2212,Food choices were poor at best. Beverage service was mediocre.
2213,Appreciate the full can.
2214,Refill service in first class was poor.
2215,Not available but flight is very quick.
2216,Not served.
2217,no.
2218,No.
2219,None of the meals in menu were available on flight.
2220,Would appreciate one healthy choice item or simple salad.
2221,"Outstanding you offered AHA unsweetened sparkling water (Blueberry Pomegranate in this case) as the other diet and regular options have limited appeal. Thanks for that... Might consider flavored ""HOT TEA"" as that also helps with queasy stomachs."
2222,Nope!.
2223,"If you do not make a purchase, you get pretzels. You can do better."
2224,"I tried to preorder the burger online two days prior. I was told the burger was sold out, however, it was offered for sale on the plane!. I should have been allowed to preorder. Thinking there was no food onboard. I purchased something at the airport."
2225,please start carrying a diet non-cola!.
2226,"I would like to suggest that United upgrade the snack to include something other than a sweet waffle, cookie or pretzel. Other than that, I believe United is on track."
2227,No comments thanks.
2228,No.
2229,More choices.
2230,The flight attendant actually gave me the wrong beer (Lagunitas instead of Kona). But I let it go as I was indifferent b/w the two and they seemed rushed.
2231,There was not enough water provided.
2232,"Wish you had a little more variety on choices. Also on a cross country flight, I wish you offered food twice. Or do what virgin did and just have people order from their seats as desired."
2233,I want to register my credit card before boarding to order beverages or up grate from economy class to business class using milage.
2234,The waffle was to much sugar.
2235,add Dr Pepper.
2236,Really good quality and portions.
2237,"A little better quality of the entre would be much appreciated. Food taste is bland. Also for an 8 to 10 hr flight, a lunch and a modest sandwich before landing is found not sufficient by most travelers. At least some snack or food availability in between would be much appreciated."
2238,"As the SIN to SFO route is a very long flight I always feel hungry midway before the next meal (breakfast) is served. The help yourself snacks provided in the pantry area was inadequate and pathetic. There were only bananas, pretzels, KitKat, tiny chocolate and plenty of potato chips. of course a few plates of cakes and cheese left over from dinner. This was significantly cutdown from what was offered on the same flight (UA 2) I took 3 months ago in June. As I am a diabetic I could not take much of the snacks you offered as I was looking for apples or nuts (lower carbohydrate fruits as low sodium snacks). Have you checked what your competitors provide for snacks on long hauls in business class?. Please check with Emirates, Singapore Air, etc."
2239,Please give entire can on long flights instead of a small cup. Please offer with no ice due to sensitive teeth.
2240,Both choices of the main meal were not something I would eat. The choices were chicken curry and vegetable lasagna.
2241,We need more food options. Maybe back to jot food or salads or at least sandwiches.
2242,The waffle was ok the fruit needs to be on the side so it is not mushy.
2243,no.
2244,Thank you for providing a full can of beverage to drink versus a full cup of ice with very little beverage. A cross country flight merits more than a sip of liquid. the full can was appreciated.
2245,Need to have Dr Pepper on hand most of the other stops have it.
2246,"Contactless purchase is not accessible to all passengers, for example my older parent, and would prevent access to food and beverage that is not complementary."
2247,Snacks.
2248,No snack served. Add something simple nuts pretzels biscuits?.
2249,Yes I would to share with you guys that United is the cheapest tikit thank you.
2250,Really a 1/2 glass of pop?. I would be nice to be offered a whole can.
2251,An IPA beer and a Cabernet wine would be appreciated.
2252,The vegan meal was great.
2253,No.
2254,No snacks.
2255,A gluten free snack option would be really nice.
2256,Improve the food.
2257,It would have been nice if dessert was served with the turkey and cheese sandwich we were given as a light meal.
2258,There was no Scotch either way.
2259,More options especially for people that pay more for premium economy.
2260,I missed receding a bag of pretzels with the beverage service.
2261,Expected better for business class. In fact it was very disappointing.
2262,They were out of the IPA beer on both flights across the ocean. The supply should be increased due to the demand.
2263,I loved that on my flight from sna to sfo they served snacks and on my flight back from sfo to sna. someone asked. the flight attendant said we do not serve snacks on short flights. That feels so cheap. can not be true because we got snacks on the way there.
2264,I like the sparkling water options.
2265,No.
2266,No.
2267,White wine was tasty and well chilled.
2268,"The presentation was appetizing, the fruit was delicious and overall it was a well balanced meal."
2269,Choices were cookies or waffle. Neither good for a diabetic or anyone watching their sugar intake.
2270,no.
2271,Healthier snack.
2272,Not enough choices for a main meal not snack. Need sandwiches or wraps.
2273,Fruit or something healthy to purchase would be nice. Not cheese.
2274,"Please think healthier regarding foods and beverages. Simple cold mineral water. Simple crudites, or a banana or apple please."
2275,"So basic. A tapas box, as only 1 of 3 box options, was very messy to eat and the only option was tearing little packages open and eating with fingers."
2276,"Refills on coffee would be nice,they got to throw out leftovers. might as well offer that up,just sayin !."
2277,"food was great, good choice of wine."
2278,"UA should offer some regional flavor food. The food is similar to what is offered on domestic flights, which is not acceptable especially in business class."
2279,We had no service since pilot said it was rough weather.
2280,Nothing.
2281,I know food sourcing is still difficult post-Covid. I hope United soon returns to its pre-Covid quality and variety of food served in Polaris.
2282,No cookie or pretzel offered.
2283,Great food!.
2284,"My only suggestion is not to serve spicy food, because of jet lag issues..."
2285,Ran out of selections.
2286,Need more options.
2287,THe food quality is very average for a business class.
2288,"no snack at all;. no food available. I know the flight was short. at least some snack should have been available, especially for Premier 1K members."
2289,I always choose ginger ale. I would prefer Canada Dry.
2290,If there are only 2 options of comp snacks just give us both!. Some attendants can be stingy with the snacks. As much as the plane tickets are we deserve 2 snacks!.
2291,Need more snack choices.
2292,Great.
2293,No.
2294,The only snacks that were offered were sweets such as cookies. It would be better if there was a savory selection such as chips or crackers as well to choose from.
2295,Please have gluten-free options for the complimentary snack.
2296,"The meal was really good quality, the choice of yoghurt. biscotti for a breakfast snack was less satisfactory."
2297,Super long 1k/polaris line at checkin (15 minutes) with 1 employee only.
2298,Food was excellent!!.
2299,No.
2300,No.
2301,Everything was fine.
2302,I was asked to provide a first and second meal option. Neither ended up being available.
2303,"Zurich to Chicago food was good. I was told there were no more business class vegetarian options and would have to get a meal from the economy class. Why are there not more vegetarian dishes available on flights?. Why can not we pre-designate dietary restrictions on the app or put in permanent dietary preferences online?. In addition, the food from Washington DC to Zurch was horrendously bad--inedible."
2304,The wine was truly awful. I would have loved a wine that came out of a glass bottle or even a decent box of wine variety.
2305,no.
2306,Good.
2307,Great drink.
2308,Good selection.
2309,The flight was under 2 hours so the choices were fine.
2310,Ran out of my first choice entree even though I was one of the first to board. Bad procedure on taking orders.
2311,Compared to the last time I flew first class the meal was 100% better. I enjoyed the entree and thought the desert tart was delicious.
2312,"I was surprised that there were NO complimentary snacks offered. Actually, the gentleman sitting beside us “treated” our beer purchases."
2313,Why were there no snacks???. That felt cheap….
2314,Would have preferred to chose from a menu. I chose a vegan meal. I did not know what I was getting. Fortunately I am not very picky. the food was nice!.
2315,No.
2316,Xx.
2317,Offer a better food option for all flights over 3 hours.
2318,Flight out to Las Vegas allowed prior food choice flight back to DC did not. I really like the option to prechoose food.
2319,I was in row 30. There was only 1 beverage cart served by 1 then 2 stewardesses. Service was delayed due to turbulence. But even without that it took “forever” to get a beverage. A plane that size should be served by 2 carts as I have seen on other flights.
2320,Thank you !.
2321,It was nice to have snacks I wish they were healthier and included a fruit.
2322,What was served on the flight was fine. What I had a big problem with was getting hot food when in terminal gate area where there was a long wait time due to having to order using a scanning app on my phone which was really confusing or order through a computer and being told of the long time for food prep even though airport not crowded. Time to go back to the old way ordering from a person and paying a cashier.
2323,all good.
2324,Dr Pepper & Diet Dr Pepper are missing.
2325,Flying first class. i would expect better snack than in economy class which was not the case.
2326,Chicken was tough but I ate it [Chicken].
2327,No free snacks!!!.
2328,Miss getting a small bag of some sort of snack.
2329,Very nice surprise to get a complimentary glass of wine!. Great touch !.
2330,Lack of ice.
2331,Ginger ale Snack.
2332,No.
2333,We travel first class and enjoy your pre-mixed old fashion cocktail. But only 2 are stocked per flight.
2334,I had a meal. Not very tasty and no variety.
2335,My salad had wilted pieces in it. the vegetable medley was dry.
2336,Great service!!!!.
2337,The continual water offering through this long flight was most appreciated!.
2338,dinner was excellent. breakfast can be improved.
2339,For a 5 hours flight a Sandwich would be great.
2340,No.
2341,bigger portions.
2342,I was served dinner too soon after take off.
2343,I accidentally put only snack but I am 1K and typically get alcoholic beverage and take off or tapas box etc. the box variety would be nice if you added one more option. I fly a a lot. the variety is just ok.
2344,I was seated n First Class. An announcement was made about meals and beverages to purchase. I was never made aware that both were available to first class passengers free of charge. I would have enjoyed a sandwich and a glass of wine. Instead I was only offered pretzels or stoopwaffles.
2345,All good.
2346,Everything was great wish you had eggs and bacon and waffle.
2347,Time to change the options. I have had the same food for 2 months.
2348,Entree of quinoa and chicken oddly combined with queso. Breakfast of strawberry yogurt and cinnamon biscotti also mismatched.
2349,On SWA they offer your choice of beverages and they provide a snack (pretzels). On United they say that due to the short flight they can only provide water.
2350,I expected that there would be at least 2 options to choose for dinner and/or breakfast but there c was no choice offered.
2351,Typical service.
2352,"In my opinion, the portion is very tiny and does not suffice for a 2-hour-plus flight."
2353,Chicken was cold.
2354,The stewardess passed my row to offer beverages and everyone in the row had to call her back.
2355,"Crown Royal, Crown Black or at least Canadian Club should be offered please!."
2356,Please add a gluten free option for a snack!.
2357,No snacks on flight from Seattle to denver.
2358,Did Not geht the meal i wanted due to availability.
2359,I chose the vegetarian option because the menu listed a crown of fresh greens. That was missing from the dish.
2360,Complimentary snacks should be available on *EVERY* flight over 30 minutes. Delta does an “express service” for flights over 30 min and under an hour which consists of one or two snack types and a mini bottle of water so they can speedily serve everyone. Rest of flights over an hour have full service. No reason this can not be the norm on UA.
2361,I hope that you keep the scrambled eggs option.
2362,I would have expected a meal on the flight that occurred over lunchtime.
2363,The coffee tasted like it [coffee] had a chemical in it. Unsure if it was the water.
2364,No snacks offered.
2365,tried the Champagne but have to say is really bad. Not cold as should be and quality really bad brand.
2366,Ordered cranberry juice. Prefer the can rather than pouring into a cup.
2367,Si good.
2368,The bagel sandwich was not tasty at all!!. But i was extremely hungry and still could not finish it because it was to me very unappealing to eat.
2369,No.
2370,please see earlier.
2371,A little bit more snack.
2372,n/a.
2373,Our 2 young children are severely allergic to peanuts and tree nuts. There were still remnants of the warm nuts served from the prior flight on our seats and on the floor surrounding our seats.
2374,No.
2375,"I think that for flights longer than 2 hours you should offer a meal, or sandwich even if you increase the price of the flight with a few dollars. Buying is annoying."
2376,The entree was rather bland. Not the best I have had on Polaris.
2377,Allowed To have more than 1 snack. But they did not give us.
2378,no.
2379,The main meal was excellent!.
2380,There is not variety of snacks. Only pretzels.
2381,A better selection of Scotch would be fantastic.
2382,"I was sleeping and never received anything. When I awoke, I was super thirsty, it would have been nice to get a water set inside the pouch in front of me, but I understand this could be a hassle."
2383,No.
2384,We upGraded to First Class. I would have thought I would get a bigger or better food offering. I was not offered early boarding or drink refill. Not first class service.
2385,We were offered cookies but no none sweet items. Do love coke products!.
2386,No.
2387,You could offer some additional main meal choices.
2388,Cups too small and sometimes they give you a full can and sometimes just fill a small cup.
2389,I do not think it is necessry.
2390,La comida poco satisfactoria.
2391,surprisingly good white wine.
2392,"The food of our return flight was good. However, there was no choice for the dinner of our departure flight."
2393,No.
2394,"I like to see more variety in meals offered in First. It has become redundant, the same entrees and sides for several months."
2395,no.
2396,Short of cabin crew so no drinks with the meal!.
2397,Flight attendant in first class took orders for pre-flight drinks. Outstanding !. First time i have experienced this since the beginning of the pandemic (and I fly almost every week).
2398,I think a second snack or just a slightly larger snack would be helpful as you are basically skipping a meal.
2399,No.
2400,"in flight I could not get my scan code to purchase due to lack of wifi, even though it was turned on in airplane mode. maybe I needed to purchase wifi to get the code to purchase?. I had the code before leaving SFO."
2401,Need more appealing options.
2402,Food and dessert excellent. Only comment was food but too salty.
2403,Flight attendant should inform you if an item is very spicy or that you are able to ask for a snack pack if the entrees do not interest you.
2404,The meal seemed to rely on spices to create flavorful selections rather than overall quality meals.
2405,I would like to be offered a bigger size water I did not wanted to ask twice.
2406,"Having flown Business Class many times during my working years (mostly legacy Continental), I was disappointed in the variety, quality, and service of the beverages and food in Polaris."
2407,no.
2408,Quick and courteous.
2409,Adding to my comment from first section of comments..... the snacks for purchase were not visually available. nothing in seat showing selection. obviously the flight attendant had not time to provide me with selection. I specifically did not eat breakfast that morning because I was going to just get a snack.
2410,The mini pretzels and ginger cookies were delicious.
2411,No snacks.
2412,Would like a more healthy snack.
2413,It was a long flight from Boston to LA round trip.No snacks wee offered after breakfast.
2414,No.
2415,"Should provide free light snack - pretzels, cookies or peanuts."
2416,Nothing was offered on second leg of flight.
2417,Snacks were bang average. Best on flight from LHR-SFO. From there the quality rapidly declined.
2418,Food served hot and fresh.
2419,It is just such a shame that times have changed for the airlines. I understand more of us flying!.
2420,LHR - SFO leg the food was good but SFO-LHR food was poor - chicken noodle stir fry quality could be improved.
2421,The halibut was not great. The burger (was not what I requested but I decided not to ask to change since they were busy) was definitely a poor choice !. I think the flight attendant (who was VERY nice) muddled my breakfast request because she gave me water with I have instead of sparkling with no ice.
2422,"Well I was extremely thirsty, so I asked for water AND a soda!. The Flight Attendant brought me 2 small waters AND a soda!. I REALLY needed that!. Thank you so very very much!."
2423,Seemed like they were short staffed so one of the pilots came back and helped serve coffee.
2424,The sandwich was not good. Lots of bread nothing inside.
2425,Snacks not sufficient.
2426,More variety in snacks and beverages.
2427,Please do not give us the choice to select a meal and then not have it. What is the point??.
2428,Needed to come around more often.
2429,"Short trip, no food acquired."
2430,I was not offered the FREE snack!.
2431,Nothing.
2432,"Variety is limited. I do not purchase any good because of that reason. I will eat at the airport before boarding, or bring my own food."
2433,Variety and bigger snack portions.
2434,For a ten hour flight the passengers should receive more snacks. The meal service has declined on United flights and the only reason we fly United is because we are from Houston so it is easiest.
2435,I would like to have Chivas Regal 12 yo (I get it in Business class))).
2436,Need to look at non dairy options for lactose intolerance people to select on the site.
2437,Did not have any food or beverage.
2438,Need to have diet ginger ale.
2439,Better selection of snacks would be great. Only the stroopwafel was offered.
2440,No comment.
2441,No.
2442,The coffee was not good.
2443,Very small serving. 16 ounces please.
2444,I liked the cookie. I would like a more substantial snack on a longer fligjt.
2445,"pretty good, but lacking a bit of being special for a business class meal. Nothing wrong, just lacking some spirit."
2446,All the food was great especially the cheese plate.
2447,It would be nice if staff passed by more often with beverages.
2448,No.
2449,"For a five hour flight, a cookie or small bag of pretzels is a tiny snack."
2450,"Thanks for the free snack boxes (because I am 1K) but they are awful, just the lowest of junk food."
2451,Providing the options for full can beverage was honored. Seconds were offered.
2452,Pasta and chicken dishes were mediocre.
2453,Just better quality and taste please.
2454,I attempted to purchase beer on my flight but was not allowed to because my credit card was not registered with united. And I was not able to download app to register my card cause WiFi was not working for whatever reason.
2455,"more free snacks, of course."
2456,The flight Attendants were amazing and went above and beyond to make my boyfriend feel special for his birthday.
2457,Thanks!.
2458,Should have apple juice.
2459,"Too short of a trip to receive service. However, on my first leg (from IAH to IAD), service was awesome."
2460,All super great <😊> I ask for hot <🥵> water <💦> for a tea I had and BLAAANG!!!. Sir Mr. Colombian very loving professional crew member was always pleasing and attending all passengers with good vibes <😎> and efficient funny talks… I do not remember his name now but he was a middle age young Colombian guy that steal the evening… I wish now his name he was exceptional!!!. Thanks guys.
2461,"I noticed an improvement in the quality of the food, especially the breakfast."
2462,The breakfast could have been better.
2463,"I am very uncomfortable using the united app for food and beverages, the credit card usage was fine for me. So, I will not be able to purchase food/ beverage on any flight because I do not have and do not care to have an app for everything I do on my phone as I do not live for that phone. Therefore, I will not be able to make any purchases."
2464,"it was not cold enough. People who asked for soda got ice but I would have liked to have ice with my water, it was warm on all flights. Also would like to see other diet soda offered beside diet cola. Diet Sprite or sprite zero or diet 7-up."
2465,No sugar free options- I am diabetic.
2466,Cookies were very delicious.
2467,It is ridiculous on a four hour flight to receive a snack!.
2468,I would pre order if given the option. Make it easy. I am a senior.
2469,"When one is celiac, it does not mean just gluten free only. Anything made from wheat,yeast flour etc can affects them too. Just something to bear in mind for future reference."
2470,No.
2471,Wanted to purchase the breakfast sandwich but that was not available.
2472,"Would be nice if they would have offered a snack like they do in first class and stuff, we pay enough for the plane tickets and not to mention we get charged extra for baggage fees. So I do not see why a simple stack would not be provided."
2473,No.
2474,Jet Blue gives more snacks and bigger selection They Give at least 2/3 per flyer and better brands.
2475,A little bit more snacks is better.
2476,My spouse and I asked for hot water but we never received it [water]. Flight attendants seemed busy - they had to go to the galley to get the hot water - so we did not follow up with them.
2477,Short flight nothing was offered.
2478,I have eaten both breakfast and they both good hot and eye appealing. Good Job. I fly early morning.
2479,short flight. only needed a beverage & snack.
2480,They can give you another can.
2481,No.
2482,"They ran out of snacks, cookie or pretzels so I only just had a beer with nothing to nibble on. I thought I heard them say that they were not restocked there."
2483,Maybe coconut water.
2484,"Again, the seat size, large passengers and full plane made managing anything to eat/drink difficult and risky."
2485,It was warm juice but it was ok. I did have to flag her for it and she skipped me a couple times. At least they were kind.
2486,Payed for a 1st class ticket ordered a scrambled eggs breakfast on the way down no problem on the way back was told no eggs left I was in 3f was told no scrambled eggs seat 2E was an upgrade and received scrambled eggs I was left with cheese and crackers not happy.
2487,Gluten free could have been offered the same dessert option as regular meal. Lemon sorbet is gluten free and would have been far tastier than dried cookies.
2488,The snack was very greasy and not very palatable.
2489,"Short flight so no in flight service, but there was time for glasses of water to be offered."
2490,Everything was great.
2491,No thank you.
2492,Better than expected food!!.
2493,I would have liked to purchased a breakfast item.
2494,nice to have metal utensils again in the front cabin...
2495,"I do not like that the flight attendant gave me a drink from an already opened can of soda. With COVID still here, it is not safe. In the flight from Houston to St. Louis, the flight attendant have us an unopened can and cup of ice."
2496,As a 1K I am usually offered a snack of some sort…I was not.
2497,More snack options would be good.
2498,Need a bit more snack towards end of flight.
2499,No.
2500,no.
2501,Even first class. Pretzels. No thanks. Food is limited.
2502,NOTHING.
2503,A vegan option in first class would be nice.
2504,The food was mediocre and not too satisfying.
2505,I am so relieved that you started having vegetarian options on your longer flights. I just wish they were also gluten free.
2506,I would like to get the option to use my credit card when purchasing food or snack not only the app .
2507,Love those little waffel snacks!.
2508,You ran out of hot food I could eat.
2509,"I did not like the beef offered. I ate only a forth of it. I did not like the way it was fixed. Okra with it?. Could have put potato instead,."
2510,"The food is much batter from the days with the kovid, but still not like the food before."
2511,Only beverages were made available for this 1 hour flight so the question is really not applicable.
2512,Illy is the best coffee on a USA airline. Do not change it!. Same goes for the Takeoff snack box. Better than the dried up chicken meal in first class. The main reason I now fly coach!.
2513,Thank you for the pretzels and variety of drinks!.
2514,none at this time.
2515,Just only offered water.
2516,Got 2 different snacks. Liked that.
2517,Exceeded expectations.
2518,No.
2519,"When United sends out info on flight entertainment, they could include food choices for 1 K members who are not seated in 1st class. I had to ask for TAPAS sitting in economy plus. Only one time in the past six months has a flight attendant informed me I could get a packaged meal and processed cheese spread is not high quality. The food is often loaded with sugar and not too much protein. Are 1 K members sitting in economy plus allowed meals?. If not, suggest United rotate their selections every three or six months for persons who travel frequently."
2520,"The only options were chicken and ""impossible"" meatballs. For business class, this is hardly what one would expect, especially on a 777. The chicken with orzo (which is what this was) has been served on most flights I have taken in the past year. Is there really no other recipe for chicken available?. And not even a simple hamburger option?."
2521,no.
2522,I just thought the food was surprisingly good.
2523,More free snack options.
2524,One flight offered beverages and one flight they did not.
2525,Offered champagne. Wish we had a snack pack.
2526,New system often free food to 1k was nice. Would like to see more fresh and healthy alternatives to snack boxes.
2527,"My complaint was mainly the flight from Newark to Honolulu UA363, Sept. 18. Not only was food dry and not good, the second meal was given within 30 minutes of landing so had to be eaten quickly. ,."
2528,I am old and do not do that app thing for buying food. so I carried my own. I am glad the water was free.
2529,"There were only 2 options. the chicken option was cold and very basic, dry and not very tasty."
2530,Thanks for taking care of the meal option I provided during booking.
2531,It was not offered on the flight from Houston to Shreveport.
2532,Beats other airlines 0.
2533,I think healthier snack options should be offers not pretzels and waffles. Hi carb.
2534,For the price one would think a better or larger snack could be offered.
2535,No.
2536,The food is strangely odd. People joke about it. We actually googled it during one of the numerous delays. ONLY3% of travelers like kale. So why?. Impossible meat?. Just strange and sadly it is always the same.
2537,It does not make sense to serve dinner on such a late departure. Why not serve a snack before bed and then a big breakfast later on the flight?.
2538,they ran out of cookies before they got to me.
2539,The food had some spices which I did not like and did not tolerade well.
2540,Better snacks please.
2541,Portions too small.
2542,More variations for us.
2543,Always of of cheese plates. Should be a standard on all flights.
2544,I wish the airline would offer complementary food for long flights.
2545,"I do not understand why alcoholic beverages were limited to one per customer for the entire flight. While I understand you do not want to have customers become wild and unruly, I do not see why you could not allow more than 1 drink per flight. I understand limiting to one at a time, but not the entire flight."
2546,Only a basket offering one waffle or pretzel bag in first class?. Really not worth any premium over economy.
2547,there was an extremely small and limited free snacks.
2548,Food is little bit boring and always the same ….
2549,Keep up the good work.
2550,Food was uncooked.
2551,Food need to be for israelis in this line. United give more food and drinks than other flight company - shapo!.
2552,"Could you, if possible, provide a protein snack?. Plus, I wish you went back to cashews or almonds."
2553,no.
2554,Should have better options for meals in first class.
2555,Poor wine quality for first class.
2556,Loved preorder option.
2557,It was great.
2558,No.
2559,No.
2560,I would like a little more variety. I understand space is limited.
2561,I did not eat a snack. Would like to have almonds as I do not sugar or carbs.
2562,"Of the four flights I took on this trip, the flight from Chicago to Washington DC was the only one that did not offer a complimentary snack. The coffee was very good, though."
2563,"There was absolutely nothing suitable for someone with celiac (gluten free). Fortunately, I brought my own."
2564,Not on this flight but the option for the bistro burger is a great addition. All flyers would appreciate changing the menu every quarter.
2565,"Delicious food, came out hot and in a timely fashion, and was delicious!."
2566,"It is been a long time since chicken in flight was anything but rubber. Yours was great!!. -tender, succulent, nicely accompanied. Thank you Salad was good too!."
2567,On my flight from Boston to London the blueberry pancakes were gross.
2568,They ran out of cookies and only could offer pretzels which I dislike. The tea was fine but they need to add honey as an option. Not many people order tea and if they do they would appreciate honey to go with it at the bare minimum.
2569,See my comment on having no plastic knife to use with the cheese and fig spreads.
2570,Do not change a thing. Great business model.
2571,Veg option was surprisingly good.
2572,Todo estaba muy bien.
2573,"Rather than the snack, I meant to select meal. System would not let me go back. I think there should have been more frequent offerings of drinks, snacks, because the flight was so long. The meal was good."
2574,provide more beverage choices.
2575,Celery root?.
2576,No everything is great.
2577,"We were not offered any snack or beverages, not even water. It is a short flight with a few bumps. there was plenty of time when seat belt sign was off to serve simple snacks."
2578,No Mr Ts bloody Mary Mix.
2579,No.
2580,Have Impossible Foods more often.
2581,The service was just appropriate.
2582,Thanks for serving one gluten free option!.
2583,Can not remember what it was. Dry.
2584,"The dinner was wonderful;. no issue-- The breakfast before landing was horrible: fruit was frozen and stuck together,: the eggs so bad I spit it into napkins and put it on the tray so the F/A would not see it.. It was not here fault. I was too embarrassed to say anything!!."
2585,"The food was generally ok, but for a business class meal it could be better flavor."
2586,It would be nice e to offered the whole can instead of partial.
2587,No.
2588,"Can they add a 2nd cookie and chip option?. Chocolate Chip, and also maybe a plain potato chip."
2589,No.
2590,No.
2591,You should offer Taquilla.
2592,"A sandwich would have been nice, but I understand how that is not possible these days. A very enjoyable flight. Thank you."
2593,There was not a snack offered.
2594,We were more than an hour late taking off. We could at least have been offered a complimentary drink or snack.
2595,Quality of meal (main course) could be better.
2596,My husband did not like the wine.
2597,I think it should be more clear about meal choices for vegetarian and gluten free options.
2598,There were very few options to choose from.
2599,No.
2600,was expected a better kind of snack in our first class flight.
2601,The burger was the last available at 23 E More stock is needed. The Burger was still warm and tasty and larger than I was expecting. I would have bought 2 if I could.
2602,More healthy.
2603,no food offered.
2604,"In general the food options usually are not great, are rarely offered or available and are way too expensive when they are offered."
2605,I would like more variety and more quantities.
2606,No.
2607,I would be great to add something really tasty to the food. More than simple cookies.
2608,Water refill would have been nice. I was on a liquid diet only post op.
2609,"There should be some kind of snack given on the flight from Chicago to Greenville. If you have enough time to have a drink, you have enough time for a snack."
2610,It would be great to have gluten free snack option.
2611,Coffee was better than usual.
2612,Nice to have a snack even if it was a short flight.
2613,Please bring back premium half bottles of wine. Your wine offering is very poor and does not taste well.
2614,not satisfied with snacks...no free snacks were offered.
2615,Wish you offer more food choices.
2616,The pretzels were extremely bland. Could you try chips or something different for a change?.
2617,It is time to offer more than water. orange juice before take off. This made sense in pandemic but makes no sense now. Other airlines serve whatever customers ask for.
2618,Snacks not gluten free.
2619,Love that you had Bloody Mary mix!!!!.
2620,I had a beer but when asking for a second there were none left.
2621,n/a.
2622,"I had 3 flights. You always ask about the best one. Now for the other 2. KOA to SFO terrible food selection!. Hot, spicy, or tofu, not!. IAH to MCO reasonable choice. My husband Maurice Landry seat 3E IAH -MCO flight #2496 Maurice Landry KG805076 had a broken tray. The flight attended had to find a blanket to level the tray as his tray slid off the table tray. He said he was reporting it, it it will not change for the next passenger. You can contact him at 8counting4u@gmail.com. I think he deserves a token credit to show your care for his difficulty eating dinner. The restroom next to gate 9 when boarding in IAH was in terrible condition. I counted 6 stalls out of order. The pages on the door were old, tattered and torn. Obviously they were very old out of order bathroom stalls. Needs immediate attention. I would really like to see a better variety in choices for meals. Not everyone likes spicy items. Also, your United clubs need more variety of foods and soups. Tomato bisque or a southwestern tomato basil soup is getting old!. Appreciate your effort to make us happy customers. Kay Landry KG 804970, krlandry@aol.com. Thank you!."
2623,There were no food or beverages served on this flight.
2624,NONE.
2625,The ice cream was really the only thing I could eat.
2626,Your beer and wine is priced to high. The price of the snack box was offensively high. The flight did not have the beer selection we wanted. We would have preferred at least a sandwich.
2627,More veggies would be nice.
2628,I am unclear how the same flight can be serviced differently despite the same number of flight attendants & flight time. Simply put the CLT to DC flight lied about the ability to serve drinks according to time restraint. I understand the stressors of working with the public (as a bartender) but it is a bad look to be dishonest to consumers as opposed to simply stating the beverage options are limited (without saying 'due to time constraints'.
2629,She was on time just as I gotten hungry.
2630,No.
2631,Thank you so much for offering hot coffee!!. It made the trip for me.
2632,If you make folks choose between a sweet snack and a sweet snack what is the choice?. I am happy to get a snack but just keep it as it is a packaged snack.
2633,Food server asked me u want cookies or Pretzels?. They should have gave us both Not only one any way it was a vary small pack.
2634,"Meal service needs an overhaul to be competitive. Portion could be bigger. fruit instead of salad for lunch is weird. you have served the same dessert for a long time. Look at what your competitors are doing. Meals do have an impact over whether I choose to purchase first class, and on which carrier."
2635,Was surprised that there were only two meal options available on a 777 plane in first class. They were also the same options as the ones we had on the outbound flight to Los Angeles which was disappointing.
2636,Please add more choices.
2637,Coffee was perfect!.
2638,Meal was very tasty for dinner. Would have liked a little more for breakfast meal. Had yogurt and biscotti.
2639,They did not have the choices that were in the magazine.
2640,You could spend a little more money and offer better food. BA does it better.
2641,I always buy a red wine on afternoon and evening flights. I am never offered a choice of red. I have a background in the wine industry. not all red wines are same. I was EXTREMELY pleasantly surprised to have a choice of two different red varietals on this flight. Well done!.
2642,9 dollars for a shooter of vodka is ridiculous!!!.
2643,I did look forward to an alcoholic beverage on the trip to Medford. I was unaware of the new system of prepayment.
2644,No.
2645,I think a upgrade snack in Business class for the SAN - SFO slight. I know it is a short flight. an upgrade on selections should be implemented.
2646,"No service, turbulence."
2647,On the flight to Denver a snack was not offered but everyone was very friendly.
2648,Having two choices in First Class (one vegan fake meat and on spicy) seems short-sighted.
2649,"This remains the weak link in the overall offering, compared to to other international competition."
2650,"It would be nice to see you offer a larger variety of chips, etc. for the free snacks. I would really love to see you get back to providing meal service, especially on longer flights. If that is not possible, it would be great to add a feature to the ticket purchase process to ask if you want to purchase food or not. If yes, provide the list of what is available so you remember to select and purchase. <:)>."
2651,Airline food is not as good as it [food] used to be. I would rate it okay.
2652,The tapas box and the take off box are both pretty similar. Would love to see more options available that are not essentially more cheese and crackers.
2653,A larger variety of options for folks with food allergies if possible!. I know it is a difficult problem to solve.
2654,I wish they would have come around with desert or a snack some time after breakfast service was complete.
2655,Could have offered a small bag of snacks like Southwest does. It is a nice touch.
2656,Thank you.
2657,"Nothing, took a bottle of water with me, that was all I needed for the flight."
2658,No food or drinks offered. A suggestion would be offering a small water bottle when we enter the plane.
2659,Quality of food service is not close to what it use to be before the pandemic although the ticket is twice as much.
2660,Excellent taste and portion size.
2661,Cheese and cracker packs would be a welcome addition.
2662,Only scotch available was cutty shark. Worst scotch ever. No happy about that.
2663,If y’all could have Dr Pepper or me pibb.
2664,I love the stroopwaffles!.
2665,More cookies should be offered.
2666,I preordered the recline boxes ahead of time for my daughter & I. When I went to preorder it for my son it showed unavailable then showed unavailable for my 2 boxes. On the flight the flight attendant did have my 2 preordered boxes. I do not know if it is a glitch or why it showed unavailable to purchase anything beforehand.
2667,Noo.
2668,Food was not good at all. Options offered are not appealing and appetizing.
2669,"It would have been nice if there would have been another drink service after the meal service (as there used to be). It would also have been appreciated if there would have been the option of a Bacardi/cola (even when paying) as there used to be. If there was the option, then I was not aware as the magazine with drink options disappeared. I guess still getting back to “normal”, but it did not feel normal quite yet."
2670,no.
2671,Bring back pre-flight drink for first class.
2672,More Variety.
2673,No.
2674,"No, all was good."
2675,They were all carbs.
2676,"The fruit and cheese plate in Polaris class was pre-packaged with meat -- which means the vegetarian customers can no longer enjoy the cheese plate. Please go back to keeping the fruit/cheese separate from the meat. The desert was a pre-packaged slice of mediocre cheesecake. Please go back to fresh deserts, either fresh baked or, even better, ice cream sundaes. The cheese plates and ice cream were ""signature"" items of United business/polaris/first class."
2677,The portions were very generous. The cloth napkin a very nice touch.
2678,No.
2679,Add Dr Pepper products. Add bread options to breakfast.
2680,Exceeded expectations.
2681,"No beverages were offered when we first boarded the plane in First Class. Other than the meal, no other food items were offered throughout our flight."
2682,needed ice in water.
2683,I got upgraded (thanks!). Was disappointed that we had the same poor snack selection (pretzels and stroopwaffles) as in coach.
2684,No.
2685,The tofu pasta stood out to me as an excellent vegetarian option. It improved my disposition toward airline food.
2686,The burger & the chocolate chip muffin were very good. The spicy chicken on the arriving flight was not good.
2687,It would be nicer to spread out the service if possible. The dessert (drinkable peaches) was odd. I ate the cookie.
2688,"Have more selections available, had to drink water because was not interested in soda drinks and Orange juice was the only different drink."
2689,I would like more no calorie caffeine free options. Cookies should always be offered.
2690,Short flight. The flight attendants did their best providing the water and snacks in the limited time.
2691,No.
2692,Yes.
2693,Really enjoyed the heated chocolate muffin!.
2694,Was great.
2695,"I know it was a short flight. I have flown FIRST CLASS on this routes several times now. depending on the flight attendant I get a nice adult beverage while waiting for take off to nothing at all from boarding to arrival at San Antonio. I think it should be a standard that even on a short flight first class should be offered a beverage (besides water) while everyone else is boarding and even in flight since there are so few of us. Thank you (I am not the only passenger who feels this way, but not sure who else will take the time to give you feedback)."
2696,My husband and I had Coca Cola. Both of ours tasted like the cans were expired.
2697,The FAs came around multiple times to offer drinks which was good. I did not buy food because it is a lot of money for what seemed like pretty ho hum food.
2698,I wish you would give water drinkers a bottle. just as you do soda drinkers. The little glass is not adequate.
2699,should provide some kind of food on board at least for 1st class.
2700,My comments are at the bevy of this survey.
2701,just need to add a hot fudge sundae should have hot fudge sauce not frozen ….
2702,No.
2703,No.
2704,It was okay.
2705,"I flew around 2 months. I was very surprised to see that you offered a real meal, not those awful sandwiches that you used to have in first class. Keep this up. it is great."
2706,We were not offered any snacks or given the option to purchase any items which is unusual for that flight.
2707,The food offered could be better quality.
2708,Had vodka and tonic but united did not have any lime!! ?.
2709,No.
2710,Extending the complimentary food items to shorter flights as well.
2711,Beer.
2712,No.
2713,"It would be nice if we got a little more info about the food before we had to choose, like how the chicken was prepared, what side dishes, what kind of pasta, etc. Maybe in an announcement so the flight attendants did not need to repeat over and over again."
2714,No.
2715,Snacks and Beverages served 30 Minutes before landing.
2716,I normally eat something much lighter at lunch time and asked if I could have a cheese plate instead of chicken dish but advised I could not get the cheese plate.
2717,"It would be nice if you can afford to some snacks along with beverage, like a small bag of peanuts or chips etc."
2718,None.
2719,Preordered a meal that was not available.
2720,"snacks where small, could have provided a sandwich on the 2-hr flight."
2721,"Options were limited entree did not taste good. The desert option was poor, a huge slice of cheesecake for a red eye, poor selection."
2722,I was offered lunch/dinner at 4:30pm but had eaten at the airport. I did not take it but would have liked a choice of snacks two hours later.
2723,Ran out of pretzels so only one small bag for a long trip but I realize this happens.
2724,I enjoyed the meat and cheese course served near the end of the flight.
2725,Not having a menu is really a bummer. There were only 2 options and neither were particularly appealing. A boxed piece of cheesecake is more appropriate for premium economy than Polaris.
2726,Love ahas.
2727,Very good.
2728,It is a long flight. More variety/options would be good.
2729,No.
2730,"No snack was offered, which is very unusual. American and Delta offer a variety of snacks in addition to a full can of soda."
2731,Pretzels or a cookie does not cut it.
2732,I was surprise to be offered snack and then a packaged cheese tray. Very impressed for a short flight.
2733,No.
2734,Jet Blue has a much better selection of beverages.
2735,Keep the Stroopwafels!.
2736,Definitely did not seem stingey.
2737,Maybe choices of sandwich is better than the snacks currently offered.
2738,Need more choices of food.
2739,No.
2740,Thank you for having a quality vegetarian option on both flights.
2741,None.
2742,"We had to ask for a can of soda (which we shared, after my brother and I got a cup of soda). No one even offered us an alcoholic beverage, even though it is included in our ticket."
2743,No snacks were offered.
2744,Your survey did not allow for saying the taste was OK what I was not as pleased with is that there was not a healthier option. Too much fat/oil especially in the dessert. I would have ordered another type of meal if it were offered but it was not.
2745,A few more options for snack boxes would be nice. Perhaps a bit more fruit or dried fruit. I know its tough to keep fruit fresh so dried fruit can be a decent substitute.
2746,No.
2747,"I preordered food but there were people in first class that had dietary needs, so I gave up my selected meal to help that passenger. I ended up with a meal that I did not order."
2748,I was able to preorder from a list of 5 breakfast options - 3 of which sounded good. Best preorder options I have seen since the pandemic.
2749,More and better foods options would be nice.
2750,Great price for these- i appreciate that!!.
2751,Kombucha or another probiotic option and Greek yogurt over normal yogurt.
2752,"please provide a low salt option, it really is the only thing missing."
2753,No.
2754,I am type 1 diabetic and they were able to get me a juice when I needed it.
2755,I remain amazed that with the price of a business class ticket on United. their food service is not much better than domestic flights. There is no variety. the comparison with other carriers is very poor. Look to Singapore Airlines for the very best.
2756,Considering that we had premium economy. I guess I expected a little bit more.
2757,Very good selection.
2758,"More so in the lounge, it would be nice to order food from the restaurant and be able to eat it at the bar. You are able to bring buffet food to the bar."
2759,Really liked we were offered ice cream!. The food was surprisingly good. Would have preferred a warm roll but put it on my entree to warm it up. Would have appreciate a wipe to wash my hands with each meal.
2760,Serving sparkling wine in economy even for sale would be great. Would be nice to have premium wine for purchase.
2761,One basic alcoholic beverage should be complimentary.
2762,Came in from overseas and my son thought he had to pay for a Coke.
2763,Lunch: quality okay. very small portions Snack before arrival was poor quality.
2764,My first choice was not available which was very upsetting.
2765,Try and refresh your meal offerings.. In my last 8 flights the same options were available.
2766,I did not eat or drink anything on this flight.
2767,I never get a prompt to pre order my meal. Not sure why.
2768,"The food was much better than expected, more flavorful and interesting."
2769,There should have been more water service offered during the flight.
2770,Hot meals on a flight this long would be appreciated.
2771,Everything good.
2772,Only spinach (chicken) meal I have ever appreciated. Good.
2773,"It would be nice to be offered the whole can of soda, some flights do and some do not. Very inconsistent."
2774,I know it was a short flight. a bag of peanuts would have staved off the hunger pangs.
2775,I got the left over serving of waffle because I did not pre order my meal. It should be clearly stated the need to preorder meals so I can get a decent meal that I prefer and not left overs because that was the only thing left.
2776,I did not receive the prepaid tapas.
2777,It will be good if there was a variety of snack selection on a 5 1/2 hour flight.
2778,They should also provide a choice of peanuts versus pretzels.
2779,Would like a cookie or something to nibble on.
2780,The flight was so short. there was no need for anything besides water.
2781,"Food focused on Latinos. Nothing appealing to me except burger , which I really did not want."
2782,No.
2783,No.
2784,"Bombay is a much higher quality than the gin one from Englsnd. -Tangerey. It is made from 5 ingredients from 5 countries, and is blended smoothly. the taste is bit harsh like Tangerey."
2785,"Would appreciate having more meal options on the flight, rather than just 2."
2786,no food was offered. I do not think any was available. But it was such a short flight none was needed.
2787,No drink from Houston Lafayette. Chicago paris was better but even in premier economy plus the attendant ask me to pay my gin And no champagne available.
2788,"Please if possible change the vegetarian dish name to some vege bowl it is very unappealing to give a vegetarian person unbelievable meat bowl the name when meat comes in it, it is not for vegetarian person."
2789,"One small glass of water for a 4+ hour flight. wow. Would like to have more water, but none was offered. I had forgotten my water bottle so was dehydrated at end of flight.."
2790,"Food was great. As it was an 11pm flight, it would have made more sense to have a light meal or snack at the beginning and a bigger breakfast at the end. I did not need a meal past midnight."
2791,No.
2792,I do miss the old days when a meal was served. Even when I go First Class food is not the same.
2793,Excellent Service!.
2794,Love the snack boxes.
2795,Thank you for continuing this service.
2796,The FA constantly checked up on me to see if I needed something else. She did not hurried up my meal.
2797,Overall good!.
2798,Have more of a variety.
2799,No.
2800,My friend on the other aisle got Glen Farclas. my host did not have any to give me.
2801,"There were no biscoff, otherwise I would have had those. So I had the stroopwaffle and I still do not understand the fascination with that thing."
2802,Keep it up the great service <👍>.
2803,Would like more variety for snacks.
2804,The chicken dinner was over-cooked and dry.
2805,"The breakfast meal when we landed was not great. I think the regular economy seats had a better set of foods to choose. The first meal however, was pretty awesome compared to airlines the past."
2806,The stewardess skipped over our row and we had to wait another hour before getting beverages.
2807,Perfect.
2808,"There should be more on offer. Though I like both, there should be more to choose from than just a strupwaffel or cookie - that was on the flight from SFO to Albuquerque. No snack at all was offered on the Ontario to SFO flight. It is small but like any kind of customer service, it is all in the little details."
2809,Thank you for providing pretzels on Thai flight. The flight from Metro to DC did not have a snack.
2810,"The flight attendant accidentally charged us for wine, even though it was supposed to be complimentary. I believe she refunded us, but it was just a bit confusing. They did remember my husband's special gluten-free order though, which was good. On the United flight to Lisbon they did not, and the flight attendant just told my husband to ""check the ingredients"" when he asked which of the 2 meal options they had were gluten free. Neither were, so that was a bummer for him. But again, that was on the flight from IAD to LIS. This flight they remembered the special orders and he got his special gluten free meals and they were good."
2811,Food on business was excellent!. Please continue to do what you are doing.
2812,They need to have ice tea.
2813,I miss the Roth Cheese plates that were available for purchase. One of the best inflight snacks ever!. I miss eating them a few times a month!.
2814,I have been on multiple international flights with United this summer and the quality of the white (and red) has truly been horrendous. You need to fix this issue. It is actually better on domestic flights which makes no sense. There is no choice and the quality if far below average. Do not try to save money in this area it will and has back fired on your service.
2815,I was satisfied with the dinner and then the snack afterwards.
2816,The snack (turkey sandwich) was delicious!.
2817,Food is so dual and boring. No healthy snacks just ultra processed.
2818,Pandemia is over. We need better foods on flight.
2819,It was a nice surprise to have the cookie!.
2820,I like getting the entire soda can.
2821,"for the night flight, a sandwich would have been nice."
2822,No.
2823,"The dinner was pretty good. The breakfast was rather bland. Dessert for dinner was a packaged brownie, which was quite underwhelming."
2824,"Quality can be improved,."
2825,I understand PDX is not a hub. catering needs are limited. the food could be better.
2826,No.
2827,Complimentary snack pretzels was not good.
2828,Just wish there were chips or ice tea <:)>.
2829,Both meals were not very appetizing. We ran out of chicken. I had to have the pasta (ravioli with pesto)- very heavily spiced. The salad did not match the meal. The I honestly woukd have been happy with a small sandwich and a cookie!.
2830,I made a mistake. I did get a meal and a snack. Sorry.
2831,"The flight was so comfortable that the time ""flew"" by. I enjoyed 4 movies on the trip. which made the time go even faster. The attendants were excellent!."
2832,I have noticed that on longer flights recently there is only one drink service. This is fine. the flight attendants do not come around to offer water. A thee hour flight is a very long time to go with only one glass of liquid. It would be nice if they were to at least offer water part way through or towards the end of the trip.
2833,"For Elderly people they may have hearing aides, they do not pick up easily. staff are talking, speaking through micraphones and do not slow speach and communication. I know you have only so much time. this is not good. your systems ont he plain are not clear enough then they come over the speakier and the pilots are not clear also. !!!!!."
2834,PLEASE rotate the chicken katsu off the menu. It is been there 2+ years and it is old!.
2835,I had a credit on file but the attendant could not find it.
2836,Very tasty.
2837,Coffee tasted awful !!!!.
2838,Need app to now purchase items. No cash or credit card.
2839,"would have preferred additional drink, and the portion size of the snack bx has gone down very much, but was happy to actually get one on this flight."
2840,"Dinner was very good, breakfast average."
2841,Thank you for the Gluten-free option!.
2842,In addition to the we had a snack. In my case a cheese sandwich. It tasted good.
2843,No.
2844,no.
2845,I think any flight over 4 hrs. They should serve at least a sandwich.
2846,Seats are less comfortable (more firm) than I recall.
2847,I was great I was a little confused about the on line ordering and card information.
2848,"On this flight the chicken entree was much simpler and good. I do not understand why food is always a high mix of many different and exotic ingredients and sauce, most of the time with spice and an asian taste. Why not keeping the food much simpler and healthy?. Like a simple past or a simple salad without strange cereal or fruit."
2849,Forgot the cookie's.
2850,No food or beverage served (short flight).
2851,Not much to it. Sent back both meals were not even warm much less hot. Saw it happened with other 1st class seats also.
2852,As a 1K traveling in economy plus there Should be a better selection for example we should be exposed to the meals being served in first class after all it is only fair what was offered to me was paltry.
2853,The food is very expensive.
2854,In an early flight for 1.5 hours a muffin would be more appropriate than pretzels Even a gronila bar would be better.
2855,"I will not be buying food or drink on United because I am not loading my credit card onto the app. I will present credit card upon purchase, but not in app."
2856,"I did not know my food would be spicy. Also I do not like quinoa, and that was the main carb."
2857,All good.
2858,The size of the cups is to small.
2859,The Eli's chocolate chip cookie/muffin was really great.
2860,It was no big deal. staff was unable to provide service due to weather.
2861,"In general I think the food choices on United flights is not great. Every time I have done a breakfast flight it is the same food over and over again. Portions are small. United should have a “normal” egg dish…not mixed with veggies such as kale, peppers, etc. How about just plain scrambled eggs?. Our French toast portion was very small as I said. We fly other airlines. food choices are better. Overall we like United but they need to upgrade their food."
2862,My seat table had a dried sticky soda streak on it…had not been cleaned.
2863,"I was surprised that there was not a hot meal offered (beef or chicken), only a cold plate or vegetarian meal."
2864,No.
2865,Ran out of vegetarian options so chose Takeoff because could eat most of it but fig packet was damaged.
2866,What happened to free snacks?.
2867,"We used to get a snack with our soda. This trip we got nothing, I can not believe that you can not offer a bag of pretzels or a bag of cookies. I mean it is not like you are giving us a lot of either, there is hardly anything in these bags, but it is something."
2868,"Yes, I know we were on a short flight, but normally they will offer water, this was not the case... I had to ask for some for the 5-year-old boy that was seated next to me.. The flight attend did get me some. I was told to crayons. coloring books were available. She was not very happy to get me water and never said a word..."
2869,A drink and pack of two cookies is insufficient for a 5+ hours flight.
2870,"Was pleasantly surprised to be offered Stroop waffle, as I was not expecting to get free food on the flight."
2871,The beer choice is mixed. As flying to Maui have more Kona beers like Longboard or Big Wave. Do not have IPAs with odd flavors like grapefruit.
2872,There are no options that I was aware of. Previously I request preflight a lower sodium option which was not available this time.
2873,Why did the last service begin so close to our destination?. It was unnecessarily hurried.
2874,It is the same stuff all the time. The snack boxes need updating.
2875,you have made me a lover of AHA.
2876,More food on board for choices.
2877,The lack of snacks is noticeable.
2878,Maybe give several during flight.
2879,The food from LHR to SFO was better than the initial flight.
2880,Would like to have a wider selection.
2881,For Premium Economy (change the name) a little more attention from flight attendants would have been nice for the price of the flight. I used the call button for a flight attendant. the blue light was in above my head. she just walked by. I used the call button about 15 minutes later to get a drink and she walked by and I had to flag her down by raising my hand.
2882,They did not offer a snack in first class.
2883,N/A.
2884,I thought the options for snacks in flight were more limited than in the past. Perhaps they were picked over. I did not see a wide range of sweeter options with more of a focus on chips and salty snacks.
2885,"The limit of one alcohol at a time is fine. beverages should be offered with the pretzel snack, then again with the main course. The white wine selection should include a sweeter selection such as a Reisling or even a blush such as White Zinfandel."
2886,Zatar chicken was good. I liked the spice.
2887,Your food service is slowly getting up to the levels of your competition (foreign air carriers as vs U.S. carriers - you are of equal-improved-better quality than the others).
2888,No snacks available.
2889,Air France food is better.
2890,Only water was offered.
2891,I was offered dessert but as it pretty much always the case it was strawberry ice cream and I am allergic to strawberries. Vanilla and chocolate are the most popular ice cream flavours so why ALWAYS strawberries?!.
2892,Would have liked a little more than the one little snack. Did not have time to grab anything between my 7am flight from Jackson to board this flight to Birmingham.
2893,No.
2894,Great service and smooth landing.
2895,Because our flight was delayed due to mechanical issues a small Snack was offered to all.
2896,The pretzel package was very small.
2897,A complimentary (alcoholic) beverage coupon would have been appreciated.
2898,"I was trying to figure why only a beverage was served from PHX-DEN, but no snack, but from DEN-GTF. I received both."
2899,could have better food.
2900,No.
2901,BURGER BUN WAS ROCK HARD. NOT REALLY WARM.
2902,"United's food and beverage quality is consistently average. Some of the options I have had lately such as the impossible meatballs, scrambled eggs, and Thai chicken noodles are excellent and must remain on the menu. Otherwise, the quality is okay."
2903,I would like to give 3 cheers to the staff that make all this happen.
2904,n.a.
2905,Surprised that there was no snack or any other food offered for an 8:40 a.m. flight.
2906,I flew in United Premier Plus on flight to and from Newark. I was surprised there were not more food options (given that food is included in this section);. in fact on my flight from LA to Newark only one breakfast option was provided (so no choice at all) and the egg quiche was inedible.
2907,The curry chicken was pretty good for an economy meal. The ice cream was also good.
2908,no.
2909,Whiskey bottle was too little and too expensive (Brandon's Dad here).
2910,First time ever I have had ice cream for dessert on a flight!. Yum!. Thanks!.
2911,I had the vegetarian meal and it was just bread after bread after bread the whole flight. Really disappointed.
2912,"The food was not good, no flavor and did not look appetizing."
2913,No.
2914,"My seatmate attempted to buy a chocolate bar, but did not know these had to be preordered. I had registered my credit card, making it easy to order a glass of wine without digging out my wallet."
2915,Your supplier is not good.
2916,It would be nice to receive something a bit more substantial than a small bag of pretzels and a cookie for a flight lasting 2 hours at dinner time.
2917,i amvery satisfy with the services. i will recommened to all my friends and family to travel with united airlines.
2918,There was no food due to the flight time. Beverage choice was good.
2919,No.
2920,Variety of snacks.
2921,No thank you.
2922,The chicken tikka from LHR to IAD was outstanding. Probably the best meal I have ever had on United. The salad was terrible - there was no dressing which made it hard to eat.
2923,The short rib was DELICIOUS!!!. and so tender. I loved it. The salad not so much. Dessert was pretty good. Breakfast was average. They did not have peppermint tea.
2924,There could have been more choices for vegetarians.
2925,"After ordering the pork entree from the on-board menu, I was informed that a beef entree had mistakenly been delivered instead of the pork so I opted for that. I pointed out that there was no salad dressing to be had, only to be informed that the dressing was at the bottom of the bowl. So I guess I am expected to try to mix the salad myself in that small serving bowl - not very professional for a business class meal. Of course everything is delivered at once on a tray which, in my mind, is also subpar for a business class service these days."
2926,More options for snacks that are free.
2927,"I appreciated the drink, but for Pete's sake, can not United provide a little snack bag?. Pretzels, cookies, nuts--just something to eat."
2928,"In economy+, where for more money one receives the same narrow seat, with a bit more leg room, I believe that United would get a lot of customer satisfaction if the meal service would be - in one way or another - better than in regular economy. I also believe that it would entice more people to choose this option."
2929,Wish there would have been a non Gluten choice.
2930,No.
2931,Based upon previous experience on UAL international flights we found the food selections improved and have told friends and family the same.
2932,Better sparkling wine like cava that is not sweet would be amazing.
2933,Paying the price for the flight nowadays and not even receiving a snack is a little disappointing.
2934,No.
2935,Different snack choices. Healthy snacks would be nice.
2936,No.
2937,No.
2938,Have travelers preselect the menu so there are sufficient amounts - international flights.
2939,No major issues with food on this flight. It was the flight from DC to Munich that had a horrible meal. Choices were vegetarian stir-fry or chicken so I chose chicken. Little did I know that it was being served on a bed of quinoa and an unidentifiable side item. I like quinoa but just a little. I had 3x more quinoa than chicken and I have no idea what the side item was.
2940,Coffee tasted terrible.
2941,Every item was tasty and good.
2942,"In my humble opinion, this flight crosses international waters and should therefore be called an international flight with meals."
2943,No.
2944,Good was terrific. I am a simple black coffee kind of a guy.
2945,I was happy with everythink.
2946,Fun. Most flights no snacks. Little kids love it.
2947,Yes more amount of food and snacks for adults.
2948,No vi opciones.
2949,Due to turbulence they did not provide beverages/snacks.
2950,No.
2951,no.
2952,You could be more creative and serve something different than other airlines. It does not cost more to be creative and leave a lasting feeling of having been taken care of. Not generic. Your snacks scream WE do not CARE.
2953,"For business class, desserts and cookies should be warmed up and not served like their right out from the fridge (unless it is supposed to be served like that)."
2954,No. It was fine.
2955,A little free snack - pretzels or granola bar would have been nice.
2956,"It would have been nice to have been offered numerous beverages continuously as they should in business class. I found the service Les than they normally have provided. It could be a Covid issue, but in business class, you should be offered lots of options all the time."
2957,No.
2958,All good.
2959,It was not enough bottled water.
2960,Only two beer options.
2961,No.
2962,The bread/ bun was cold. I would have preferred this to be warm.
2963,Great.
2964,Best kosher food that I had.
2965,You really should have a basic choice for when the two more elaborate selections are not appealing. Like two hot dogs or a hamburger and fries. Even if it is pre-order only. Sometimes I do not like the over done type of meals and just want food.
2966,This is a long flight . Meal should be serve without extra cost. Or you can add in your costing.
2967,Breakfast was not satisfying.
2968,Not ready. It was just enough & My flight was short.
2969,No.
2970,I enjoyed the pasta dish a lot!. Also had a snack plate with cheese and crackers. Delicious!.
2971,No.
2972,Delicious meal. Flavored water (grapefruit) was really good.
2973,The good quality was fantastic.
2974,pleasant.
2975,Everything was fine.
2976,Where have the snacks gone??!.
2977,No.
2978,It was a 3-hour flight in 1st class. I was expecting a bit more than cheese and crackers.
2979,"I received a complimentary upgrade to first class. I was expecting a snack box, but instead was provided with a full meal. The quality of the food was excellent (shredded chicken on a bed of orzo). I enjoyed the quality of the service, the presentation, and the cutlery and glassware."
2980,no.
2981,Giving more drinks and more food verity would be appreciated.
2982,Diet Dr. Pepper would have been better.
2983,Would like to see better food options.
2984,I am fine with food and beverages.
2985,If the flights were longer I would still be hesitant to purchase a meal as it requires a credit card prepayment and sometimes that is not what you have in mind.
2986,Yes.
2987,Better snacks & more variety!. I guess the old days are gone.
2988,Please give out 2 or 3 pcs of the snack - like the small kiddie size pretzels.
2989,If one buys a first class ticket it would be nice to be offered a beverage before takeoff especially if it is known that we will be delayed.
2990,Give choice a cup or full can 2 adults sharing 1can. Then nothing else to drink for next 3 hours.
2991,"I have been in a number of the round trip flights recently. a change up in the offerings would be nice. The crew meal looked better than the chicken meal I received. Chicken was good. the sides were not very good. Loved the hamburger for the snack before landing. Again, the crew was fantastic and the service was a 10 plus!."
2992,The wine option has never been really great. The white is not really cold. the red always seems off. Wish United could pick different wines to serve.
2993,Yea was served without milk When I asked for milk flight attendant poured last drops from the pack and did not ask if need more.
2994,no.
2995,No.
2996,You can feel the cost savings with food...not good idea for 9 hour traveling.
2997,all should be free even if limited.
2998,"United does not seem to be able to get vegetables right. The broccoli I had with my impossible meatball was the right texture and not over cooked, but it looked sad and gray. But it was a huge improvement over the dinners I had during my trip to Europe earlier this summer."
2999,Was happy to see vanilla flavored yogurt. Most of the time it is Strawberry which I can not eat strawberries.
3000,"The transcend food service needs to step up to what it was before -- somewhat equivalent to international service. Not there yet, so not meeting expectations in Polaris cabin."
3001,"no, thank you."
3002,"Listing specialty foods' nutritional info when Making selections would be very helpful. Ex: I am non-dairy, low sodium and low carb. I can not tell if the Vegan choice will meet my needs. Even just a simple green salad option (with dressings on the side) would suffice. I can work with that if I know going in what to bring to enhance a salad (unsalted nuts packs, tuna packs, other proteins)."
3003,"It is an inflight meal. No matter what you do it is still going to suck. I do not blame United, that is just the way it is."
3004,I would like bigger cups with more drink.
3005,No service due to turbulence.
3006,We were offered one snack but no drinks.
3007,Admittedly I included comments for trip to BWI from SFO as stated in first comment section.
3008,"I would prefer a fresh fruit option instead of a frozen dessert. The ice cream was not good, too cold and tasteless."
3009,Overall very satisfied....
3010,I miss the warm nuts and hot towel. We have not had that service since prior to COVID. It is time to bring it back. Really nice way to breakup the flight.
3011,Yes... Some flights GET IT. This flight did. sometimes they do not offer you a beverage until after the food service. It is WONDERFUL to have an aperitif drink ( love the warm nuts too) and then glass of wine w meal. This always happens in Europe...
3012,Being able to only purchase from App is inconvenient for most travelers. Need more snacks for each person on longer flights.
3013,I miss getting the stroopwafel.
3014,Loved the beef shortribs ... best United meal we have had!.
3015,First class did not get good attention.
3016,"limited scotch, need Chivas or Johnny walker black."
3017,"It was about a 7 hour flight so we got a meal shortly after we departed. And, before we landed we had a choice of meal as well. And short snacks were available during the flight as well."
3018,"I would have the beverage cart serve first. If you get a snack or BOB, you may have to wait quite a while for a beverage."
3019,Good selection.
3020,NO.
3021,"Gluten free meals were repetitive (chicken twice). The chicken was dry. Sides— risotto, fruit salad & brownie— were delicious."
3022,The only time beverages were offered on a 5 hour first class ticket was with the meal. Nothing was offered at anytime after the meal.
3023,A free snack would be appreciated.
3024,Better quality please.
3025,Great cranapple.
3026,None made available.
3027,Or take off we were offered a choice of water or champagne as opposed to before covid when we were asked what we would like to drink.
3028,The food on this flight was better than what usually gets served on this route.
3029,the meat could have been less dry.
3030,Again the choices were limited and not all were available- for a paying customer this is always disappointing.
3031,"Service in first class used to include pre-flight beverages such as mimosas. The food was good but not as good as other airlines first class, business class food (e.g. Aer lingus, Qantas). On the Missoula to Denver flight, we were offered pretzels or swedish carmel waffle cookie."
3032,Not good selection;. too fancy.
3033,Did not get a offer for a free snack.
3034,"sitting in your polaris class seats on a domestic rated flight I would have expected better food service like international business class. Most food items were dry to the taste, with small portion sizes. No pre order meal service was offered online or through the United app, which was super disappointing. Food choices was bad for this kind of long distance, almost international style flight between mainland and Hawaii. Refer to earlier general service comments . . . back in the day when I lived in Hawaii and travelled to the mainland (early 70's and 80's) United was the top dog on overseas travel. Now sad to say your not the best between mainland and the islands."
3035,"My husband and I have made this flight numerous times. There were always just 2 dinner/lunch offerings and they were the same for the last 2 or 3 years - and were not all that good, either. Thank you for giving us new and different choices that were delicious and actually difficult to choose between!. I will look forward to our meal on the next flight!."
3036,Very good flight.
3037,Chicken zatar was rubbery. the vegetarian option was actually tastier.
3038,A few more free snacks on a cross-country flight seems warranted.
3039,None.
3040,N/a.
3041,Would have liked the return flight to have included a small snack.
3042,Quite good all in all. As long as there is some non-red meat option. I am usually satisfied.
3043,It would have been nice to have been offered a cookie.
3044,The breakfast served was inedible... I had waffles my husband had eggs... Both inedible.
3045,"I prefer Pepsi products in the future, if possible."
3046,"If the flight is more than two hours, some complimentary snacks should be served at no cost."
3047,We had trouble loading our credit card and could not order… more emphasis should be given to having that completed… second trip we did it and we are able to order.
3048,No pretzels /chips/snack even offered to me.
3049,would like to have warm nuts please.
3050,No snacks offered on the flight.
3051,The bread roll is rocking hard and cold like a ice block!.
3052,N/A.
3053,It would be nice to have more complimentary snacks and move away from purchase snacks. Even if it means paying more for the flight up front.
3054,Lower sodium please. Dishes are too salty. Can we get a lower sodium tomato juice / Bloody Mary mix?.
3055,No.
3056,Have a menu option for children.
3057,You need a bigger variety of snacks;. maybe a fruit selection also.
3058,"The bread was very cold (in entrée, or sandwich)."
3059,Food itself was not so good this time.
3060,The flight attendants did an awesome job. We only had 1 attendant on the Denver to Moline and Moline to Denver flight.
3061,Not enough quantities.
3062,Pretzels were stale.
3063,More choices notnjudt pretzles and biscows.
3064,"The eggs/ham/potatoes was the first good meal I have had on United in 4 years-and I always fly first class. Every other time, it was as if you are preparing for a tv food star. In short, it was not too spicy or exotic. Just pain food, prepared well , and absolutely delicious."
3065,Great variety to choose from.
3066,I could not eat any of the complimentary snacks offered due to gluten allergy. In all honesty I miss the days when peanuts were offered. (Gave my snack to my husband.).
3067,Ice was given to me without asking.
3068,.
3069,I wanted another beer and did not get it [beer]. Flight attendant told me to go to galley.
3070,Nice flavor and portion size for the scrambled egg entree.
3071,nothing.
3072,Not enough available choices for purchase.
3073,The sandwich we were given just before landing was not good. Suggest you try Burger King or Jimmy Dean.
3074,No.
3075,"As a vegan passenger, I would suggest making sure you check the passengers that asked for special meals. On my flight back, they almost forgot I asked for special meal. In addition to that, make sure you check the ingredients of the food you serve: I was served a blueberry muffin which contained eggs but as vegan I could not eat it and I was a bit disappointed by this mistake."
3076,Love love love the gluten free food!!!. Yeah baby.
3077,I like stroopwafel and the flight did not have it [stroopwafel].
3078,no.
3079,Purchase food or beverage on flight.
3080,This flight on 9/15 offered a nice variety of drinks. my flight on 9/13 only offered water and coffee.
3081,"As someone who has a restricted diet, I was very happily surprised at the options as they coved most everyone."
3082,The pasta were really delicious . The plastic cutlery is getting very tiny. No sparkling wine was offered even though we are global services . It would have been nice to get it from business . We had actif so could not travel business.
3083,The burger was over microwaved so it was flat and gooey.
3084,"There were no snacks, just soda or juices. I believe there was coffee. nothing to munch on."
3085,"Gate A87 at Denver is way…. out there from Terminal B. When the doors are open for arriving passengers, it blows through the area like the prairie wind. But, the waiting area is pleasant except for windy moments (15 minutes)."
3086,Hot and Cold options would be nice - cereal with milk in First class could be an option.
3087,Breakfast was 1 option. I would prefer a choice.
3088,Pls increase portions and quality on flights originating in the states.
3089,The ice-cream dessert was not cold enough.
3090,Burger unexpectedly good.
3091,The Belgian waffle is always a favorite. Excellent option.
3092,The food was 'satisfactory' and getting a little better. There could be some improvements in the food. Sure liked the meals in the '80s and 90's. We miss the Sundae cart in First Class!.
3093,Please consider adding other options.
3094,No.
3095,The food in business/Polaris was mediocre at best.
3096,Snacks not provided. Limited drink options.
3097,Short flight no beverage offered.
3098,food should be healthy. Better something simple and good.
3099,I struggled with both vegetarian meals on this flight. Flying is dehydrating. both meals were served very dry. I had trouble swallowing them. The Tortellini had about one teaspoon of sauce for the whole meal which was inadequate.
3100,I ordered a burger. since there were no salads. I received an egg sandwich. The flight attendant offered me something else and I got one of the boxes.
3101,No.
3102,"No, I was sleeping."
3103,It would be nice if more water was available.
3104,No.
3105,Please offer crisps (potato chips) instead of Pretzels. Main meal was ok. choices were limited in Premium Economy.
3106,Good.
3107,coffee was cold.
3108,Wanted diet Dr Pepper.
3109,No.
3110,Burger was mediocre and warm.
3111,Perhaps a couple of more options for snacks.
3112,Indian dinner was good. Lunch was a few slices of zucchini and eggplant in a bread. I was hungry.
3113,For business class the food has dropped in quality and what is offered compared to years ago.
3114,Tea was cold. the menu options were very limited for non-meat eaters.
3115,No.
3116,It would be helpful if the airlines in general will change the variety of the offered snacks. They are always the same in a very redundant not particularly good.
3117,"Please provide a few more white wine selections, such as Pinot Grigio."
3118,The pre-departure business/first class difference in treatment of passengers as provided on a prior question.
3119,Not a lot of options especially in First Class.
3120,"Sandwich is not complete a meal, an announce before the trip was enough to understand it."
3121,Excellent.
3122,No I only received a cookie.
3123,The food was okay. A lot of rice with the chicken. Fruit would always be welcome. The coffee was good.
3124,"They served us breakfast an hour before we landed in Johannesburg. Scheduled arrival 5.45pm, actual arrival 6.45pm local time. That makes absolutely no sense."
3125,The food options where 2 and lots of carbs on both. I chose the vegetarian option and it was not that good either. The crew passed by twice on a 15 hour flight. Never saw them again.
3126,no.
3127,No.
3128,Very good.
3129,Thank you for taking my comment from the last flight and ordering a Gluten Free meal for me.
3130,In United flights the food is so far always fine.
3131,food is average at best. Worse than pre-covid. Appetizer terrible. Also dessert is very lazy. Before there was a dessert cart. now just a frozen sundae with frozen chocolate. Very poor.
3132,Short flight -no service.
3133,We would have preferred a lunch offering on this flight instead of breakfast.
3134,Truly outstanding in every way!. My husband and daughter felt the same way. Thank you!.
3135,None.
3136,No.
3137,Dairy free vegan options too.
3138,you never have herbal tea. I do not drink tea with cofeein.
3139,Attendant brought me water late in flight. So kind.
3140,"I wanted to have a diet coke and the flight attendants told me that they were not available, kind of surprising."
3141,The Scotch offered was not as advertised (a lower quality blend vs a single malt advertised).
3142,Chicken was good spicy with nice rice. Not bland as usual.
3143,"We had a total of 4 flights. On our 1st two flights, the food options were satisfactory and good. We had the option to choose from 5 options. On the flights home we only had 2 options and they were the same options on both flights. That was disappointing. neither one was good. I only enjoyed the fruit, bread and cookie on the way home. We took lights UA1535 and UA1006 on 9/9 from New Orleans to Seattle and UA1630 and UA1478 on 9/18 from Seattle to New Orleans."
3144,Flight personnel were friendly and professional. Security was tight as it should be. We did not mind the wait and appreciated the safety procedures.
3145,Snacks were marginal.
3146,I LOVE that you offer great variety of drinks. Thanks!. I would LOVE that you offer snacks and have a sweet and salty option. I would love a change as pretzels and cookies is strange on a 6am flight.
3147,Would like if they asked a second time on longer flights.
3148,"The overnight oats recipe was too busy with stuff--chia seeds, banana, coconut and chocolate chips. While they should have worked well together, it did not quite taste harmonious."
3149,Great coffee.
3150,All meals/snacks were good.
3151,Both were stale.
3152,First class had limited options. food was too fancy.
3153,I appreciate the option of ordering a snack due to my Premier 1K status.
3154,"Coke products are extra bad for you, using aspartame and other dangerous chemicals. Switch to Pepsi products with sucralose."
3155,no.
3156,I ordered the cheese plate for dessert The crackers served were GREAT!. Best ever !. Cheese selection too bland.
3157,I was charged for a premium beverage and sold a Jack Daniels.
3158,I would like to see more variety in lunch and dinner in business class from flight to flight. The same choices are offered time after time for lunch and dinner.
3159,"I tried all of the types of cookies which were good. Would like to see Orange, Dr Pepper or Cream Soda offered. The Denver to Vancouver flight service was extremely slow. From the time the cart came out and made its way around, over an hour transpired. It should not take this long on a full flight. From Minot to Denver, your attendant spilled someone's water on me. Lucky it was only a little bit, and only water. She gave me additional snacks and a napkin."
3160,The Belgian waffle was soggy. Only option available in first class. Disappointed. That is the third time that has happened to me. Does not seem right for a first class ticket to get what is left.
3161,I actually was looking forward to a Stroopwafel but it was not an option on my flight. I do like the Biscoff but was disappointed (for about 30 seconds). I also really like the Ah-ha waters.
3162,"I had hoped that on this long cross continental flight, that the stewards would be asking if you wanted another water. Keeping hydrated is very important when flying, especially on long flights."
3163,All delicius.
3164,Good food.
3165,No.
3166,"Maybe add 2 more selections, of course within reason per cost per customer."
3167,Nothing.
3168,The kosher food was new and delicious so give passengers more choices.
3169,Need more different choices.
3170,chicken was dry.
3171,"I could be mistaken but I think we only had 2 beverage services (immediately after takeoff + after the pre-landing snack). There is typically a 3rd beverage service following the lunch meal, which would have been nice in this case, but the flight attendants were very responsive to additional one-off requests (ie for coffee) so it was not an issue overall."
3172,Food was non existent.
3173,Maybe having a more variety. It was ok.
3174,No.
3175,no.
3176,It seems the quality in the food was not as good as should be in Business class.
3177,"Pretzels and cookies were fine, though small portions. However I and supposed to cut down on both sugar and salt - for medical reasons. So airplane food - either the little snack or the food for purchase do not seem to satisfy me needs. I do realize I could stop and buy something before boarding - but not convenient for the wheelchair pusher."
3178,No.
3179,Very good.
3180,no snack provided like before.
3181,When I flew from Denver to Boston I was able to pre-order my breakfast which was great!. I got the oatmeal and it was exactly what I wanted. It would have been nice to have that choice on the Boston to Denver flight.
3182,Food is very expensive.
3183,"I was disappointed with the chicken meal. I could not cut the chicken with my plastic fork and knife, so I do not know how it tasted. I did not like the pilaf side dish at all. The roll was okay but not fresh tasting. The chocolate covered nuts were good. That was the dessert. We were not served a separate dessert."
3184,"Dinner meal was cold, chicken and roll almost frozen. Should have been heated."
3185,It was to much food for me.
3186,Yummy water.
3187,More food choices.
3188,"The flight attendant informed me before departure that I may, or may not, receive the meal I pre-ordered. She said sometimes 'they' get it right and sometimes they do not. I would find out in flight when it was served to me. It was one of the most bizarre exchanges with a flight attendant I have ever had."
3189,Low calorie drinks if available will help those who do want to take high sugar drinks.
3190,"Peanuts would be nice, or potato chips."
3191,This was my first time flying business class on United. It was not clear what beverage options were available. A list of options to choose from would be appreciated.
3192,Everything was excellent. Can think about adding a sandwich or a burrito.
3193,No.
3194,so we have now eliminated snacks?. There were none between Philly and Chicago.. I know things are tight but if we can not get some cookies or pretzels that is a new low.
3195,No.
3196,To many questions.
3197,wish there are real meals served in this flight.
3198,"Just as I mentioned in a prior section for a 6 hour flight and paying for a 1st class ticket. I would expect some food other than a simple breakfast. To be fair we got a peppermint hard candy at the end, but I have always been offered another round of some type of snack (e.g., chips, cookies, sandwich) but nothing was offered. I did notice a few customers in 1st class said they were hungry and wanted more food and were offered whatever was on the ""for purchase"" menu in Coach."
3199,"Most flights do not get offered snacks like pretzels or other snack food with the drinks, only drinks."
3200,Business class used to have a much better wine selection. the selection of wine was not presented at all - visually or via a menu card.
3201,NA.
3202,only one choice besides vegetarian.
3203,N/A.
3204,It would be nice to just have a sandwich with fruit and a snack. My opinion on hot meals is like having a TV dinner But I must note I had beef short rib on the way over that was very good ….
3205,More options for business class meals. Main meal and during flight meal for vegetarian were the same.
3206,Too many carbs. They did not have a choice left!!!. I had to eat the fish as the rest was finished.
3207,Only water offered because they said was turbulence.
3208,Would like a better choice of snack.
3209,As I said before I think a little snack like nut or pretzel and cookies would be nice.
3210,Food was the best I have ever had in a plane!.
3211,"I am a 1 K. They should offer the snackbox, I should not have to ask for it."
3212,the meat could be more tender.
3213,"I used to love when peanuts were served. I understand why peanuts can no longer be served and I am not suggesting they return. However, I can not eat gluten. there is no gluten free option for a snack."
3214,I love sparkling water and happy it [water] is offered on the flights.
3215,the wine was truly dreadful (but I was an economy passenger). A big bottle of opened Chardonnay. Really difficult to drink.
3216,None were offered or available…. Flt too short.
3217,No.
3218,"oh!. I was answering for my flight from Houston to Santiago!. Flight Mexico to Houston too short, only a snack. By the way, no allergen proprerly warned. my wife has egg allergy and no way to make sure the served food is approprate, so she did not take food."
3219,No.
3220,Not offered a second glass of wine. Not asked about dietary requirements.
3221,The taste of the chicken entree was ok. not enough considering the pasta salad was not a tasty one to try. I did not eat bread either - cold from a freezer so I ended up being still hungry as that one plate of chicken did not fill me up.
3222,The ice cream came out with the food so it was melted by the time I finished the meal.
3223,No thanks.
3224,The snack sandwich (cheese baguette) was really inedible.
3225,no.
3226,"On a red eye from SFO to BWI LEAVING AFTER 11pm, nobody needs a cheeseburger or chicken dinner!. How about offering a snack?. Cheese and crackers maybe?. Nuts?. Also how about some ketchup with a cheeseburger??."
3227,The meals are adequate but the quality and variety is not what I would expect on an international first class flight. If you want to distinguish yourselves among competing airlines you need to offer a more elevated selection.
3228,Sparkling wine.
3229,Overall very good.
3230,No.
3231,Would like to see UA add DR. Pepper or Mr. Pibb as an offering.
3232,NONE.
3233,I would like to see iced tea served!. Breakfasts pre pandemic were much better than those on this flight.
3234,"SERVE THE BEVERAGES FASTER, IT TOOK 2 HRS FOR A 2.5 HR FLT."
3235,I ordered a tapas but they did not have any so they gave me something else.
3236,No dressing on plane for the salad. The food was good but never looks a good.
3237,Surprised that with our flight time that only 2 cookies were offered.
3238,I would have liked one more beverage in between.
3239,Would like a ‘light’ option for all meals on flights that offer meals-don’t want dinner at11pm.
3240,Snack.
3241,Real Milk sachets for Tea instead of cream please <:-)>.
3242,Food was better than I expected. In past seemed quality was going down so I was pleasantly surprised that food service seemed to be improved.
3243,Apple did excellent.
3244,No.
3245,"Your options were for dinner. I was on a breakfast flight from Sac to Houston, but had dinner on the return flight from Houston to Sac. The red wine was excellent."
3246,The meal was really good.
3247,No.
3248,"I find it odd that they take your toenail clippers, but on the flight hand you a steel knife ?. Also find it odd that with ""Premier Access"" you do not need to remove shoes/belts...... but you do in standard cabin ? ?."
3249,Food choices and quality was lacking for the price we paid for FC. I said no dessert but did have a little cookie/brownie with meal.
3250,Flight is too short so understandable to have no food.
3251,I asked for chicken he gave me vegetarian. he went too wick before I could say anything. It was nice. not what I asked for.
3252,"The chicken entree and beef entree were delicious. however there was no options for dessert apart from lemon sorbet. Sour desserts are contradictory and not many people like it, including myself. United should provide more common flavors such as vanilla and chocolate ice cream."
3253,Did not receive any beverage or food as the crew members delayed the flight.
3254,"No vegetarian option offered on the snack served prior to landing, it contained egg and was labeled vegetable sandwich."
3255,I just feel that on a flight of almost 4 hours the snack could have been larger.
3256,I had upgraded to first. the offerings met my expectations.
3257,Disliked having to again add another app so I took my own water.
3258,The app. Did not keep my card. #.
3259,The snack and coke were fine. I do not like to purchase meals and eat them while I am sitting so close to people who may not have been able to purchase them.
3260,Burger was way overheated which caused it to be soggy and I had to wait awhile for it to cool down before I could even touch it without burning my hands. Cookie pie was amazing thought and should be offered with every meal.
3261,Portion could have been bigger.
3262,No.
3263,The flight attendants were great. Gluten free option for free snack would be nice.
3264,It was ok..
3265,Waffle just not good. Was not told toppings were on it. My husbands eggs were cold.
3266,Should provide more adult snacks.
3267,The flight attendants were superb. The food could improve.
3268,Was fine.
3269,I wish you would bring back the free snacks like pretzels.
3270,Have better options for a 10 hour flight.
3271,More water is always appreciated. Not a fan of the burger served onboard.
3272,I have been in United First Class for 15 years. The quality of food on this flight was exceptional. And surprising.
3273,Wish there were better/more choices.
3274,"For a 5-6 hours flight I would expect at least a small meal, but other than that very happy with the overall experience."
3275,No stroopwafels available on our flight which was a shame.
3276,Would like to have bigger size snack.
3277,My husband has celiac diseases and it would be nice if a snack option safe for him was offered.
3278,Loved the Albariño. A champagne option would have been nice.
3279,Dark rum from USVI or Belize.
3280,All was good but we were never offered drinks after breakfast. On a 4 hour flight they should come by for drink service a couple of times.
3281,"The flight to Denver had excellent food, chicken in creamy mushroom sauce. The chicke the way back to FRA was a bowl of dry Quinoa and three little peaces of chicken. Not good. Thank god i ate somthing in the United Club."
3282,Thank you for bringing back the food experience in first class. We thoroughly enjoyed it.
3283,no.
3284,"The Thai Curry chicken was awesome. The ancient grains ""salad"" served with both meals was disgusting."
3285,"The water I received was about half a glass with no ice. It is not super necessary, but it would have been nice to have ice included. I do not think ice was included in the soda drinks the people in my row ordered, either."
3286,Never stop serving your cranberry juice cocktail <😂>.
3287,"Better food, more options."
3288,Good service and nice crew.
3289,The selection of beverages was amazing!.
3290,I did not get offered the good snacks The wine and spirits selections were not great.
3291,No.
3292,Chicken was 80% gristle Was very off-putting.
3293,Why did you remove the dark chocolate bananas ?.
3294,The beef entree was very delicious. As good as a steakhouse.
3295,"What happened to the Pasta option?. I have always preferred the pasta entrees, and my observation was that other passengers also liked the pasta."
3296,"Can you provide snacks, not only drinks?. Thank you."
3297,We were not offered a snack. your survey would not let me go back. I liked getting a full can when ordering a complimentary beverage.
3298,No.
3299,Do not change a thing.
3300,"They could have gave us a cuppa coffee, tho it was a short flight."
3301,Everything good.
3302,No.
3303,Thank you for having certified peanut-free snacks!.
3304,The chicken was very dry. Taste was ok. Chocolate cookie cake dessert was delicious.
3305,I have tried to load the app for contactless payment. i have not been able to whie younger people are able to do things on phone. computer older folks may not be able to.it would be nice to still be able to purchase something. My husband would have had a mixed drink. only problem had everything else was great.
3306,No.
3307,The inflight meal was delicious for an adult. I traveled with my 9 year old who did not eat because the meals were not appealing. Maybe have a child option or something that can be consumed by adult and child. The flight attendant did go above and beyond and provided a snack box for us.
3308,cheesburger served in business class was very good and am glad that I chose it.
3309,Quinoa-chicken dish was really excellent.
3310,The cookies were unusual. It was refreshing to have something different on the flight.
3311,"My only complaint about the flight is, there was no breakfast. For a 6 AM 4-hour flight in business class, I expected breakfast."
3312,Please add tequila to your options.
3313,None.
3314,Breakfast portion size was too small. Just a yoghurt and a breakfast bar.
3315,"I flew 4 segments in 9 days, and had the same meal on all 4 flights. It was barely ok for me as I am not a fan of spicy food. would have preferred something less salted and spiced."
3316,non.
3317,Very cordial.
3318,"It is a very long flight. Therefore, I strongly believe there should be complimentary food for every passenger in the airplane, not only First/Business Class. I does not need to be fancy, just enough to withstand the flight, but not just a cookie."
3319,No.
3320,Often times airlines do a “second round” delivery for drinks and its really nice to have that.
3321,No.
3322,All good.
3323,Do not want to have to use contactless payment that you have to sign up for in advance.
3324,"I enjoyed the unexpected snack of hummus, grapes and tabouli that was received. Also, I loved the pretzel roll that I got with my lunch,."
3325,Need more choices on the food menu / change up the snack boxes and bring on new experience traveling at 35K feet watching a movie with dinner.
3326,It is still very disappointing that in United First they are still only offering a small bag of pretzels on the flights from SFO to YVR. This is a flight that is plenty long enough. you can do better. Air Canada offering full meal service.
3327,Great service.
3328,Do not like the fact that we have to use an app to buy anything on the plane. I feel you are looking revenue.
3329,Would like to see a better red wine selection!.
3330,No.
3331,The selection was not very broad (a chicken entree and a vegetarian entry. I flew JetBlue Mint on the way to Boston and the meal (as well as seating comfort) was far superior.
3332,On the return flight there was no food for all the passengers...... I was sitting at the back of the plane and there were only vegan options left.....
3333,"Would prefer an appetizer or fresh garden salad, instead of the fruit."
3334,N/a.
3335,Food needs to improve big time. 10-20 years ago was much better.
3336,No thank you.
3337,The flight was too short to do food or beverage service. in general all flights in the past have had good options.
3338,"They only offered coffee and water. I drink decaf coffee but not regular. I would have liked decaf, tea, or Diet Coke."
3339,"Having healthy options such as organic/fresh fruits, chips, nuts would have been great. Also, I would appreciate if you could add halal option to your list."
3340,No.
3341,Would like a snack like a cookie also provided.
3342,No.
3343,Not bad.
3344,Appreciate that you still give out pretzels and drinks.
3345,Soda was cold.
3346,No.
3347,Limited variety for snacks.
3348,Need sugarfree caffeine-free sprite or ginger ale.
3349,Everything was very satisfying.
3350,Vegan options were delicious.
3351,Food was cold and does not feel like waiting for next round of food.
3352,"I thought the dinner selections were not appetizers at all. Lamb shank, salmon, chicken curry."
3353,Way too much garlic in the vegetarian meal and only 2 choices. Not great for the money paid.
3354,In First Class we should have unlimited drinks and a choice of food. Flight Attendants were nt attentive and ran out of food.
3355,No.
3356,Why is there no beef or even pork as an option?.
3357,United need to change the manu as this was the first change of manu since 2020.
3358,"FA took orders like pre-order was not even applicable. Overall, the pre-ordering of meals is hit or miss on United and would be great if you can figure out how to consistently meet the expectations you set by offering this."
3359,No pretzels.
3360,"The Domestic dinner choices currently available (spicy chicken, meatless meatballs) are both rather mediocre and trust that as things continue to pick up this will change. On a positive note, the breakfast options (notably the ""scramble"" plate - my current choice when avaiable;. an excellent dish!). seems to be quite good!."
3361,Not enough of diet coke which made me choose something else.
3362,No.
3363,Having 3 bathrooms reserved for first class which leaves only 3 bathrooms for the rest of the plane does not work. Premium economy should be allowed to use the „rear first class“ bathrooms to avoid congestion but the „United bathroom Nazi“ would not allow. Very annoying.
3364,There were very few choices for beer or wine selection.
3365,The options were a cold chicken entree or a cheese tray. The cheese tray had both crackers and bread- too much. I would have liked some meat along with the cheese. Did not like the chocolate filled cookie. The fruit was quite good.
3366,Chicken was quite dried out. Really liked the sliced fruit instead of a dinky salad with the dressing that burps out of the container when opened.
3367,"I think we should have been offered more drinks, I mean they should offer seconds."
3368,I am happy that you offered snacks. Sometimes traveling does not offer time to plan meals. your snack means a lot to me.
3369,"I just drank water. I would have liked a larger cup, or offered the whole bottle."
3370,For a six hour flight not enough food was served. Also not enough options. Only two options avail able.
3371,I wanted sparkling water and was told only club soda was available.
3372,Nope.
3373,"The pretzels while they are good from an allergy perspective (Biscoff has soy which I am allergic to), they kind of have a stale taste. This is not limited to this flight, but in general. It would be nice if there was any more nutritious. lower salt option as a snack, like maybe dried fruit/trail mix. Also, it would be nice on the descriptions of the snack boxes in the brochure if they listed the allergens."
3374,"I purchased a bloody mary and was not given the can of bloody mary mix like usual, I was told that there was only 1 can and that because of that she could only fill my cup 3/4 of the way."
3375,I wanted a drink or wine.
3376,No salt or low salt options for food.
3377,Never receive my email so I can choose meal prior to flight.
3378,"This was the first United flight that had good red wine in the economy service. This was really surprising, and a very nice step forward!. In the past, the red wine was pretty awful. You might wonder why I still try it when I expect it to be pretty bad, but I kept hoping that it would improve one day, and I am happy to report that it has!."
3379,Got hot water.
3380,why not offer sandwiches?.
3381,"Although flight attendants frequently served water and provided additional two bottles of water, coffee was served only once before the meal. I usually see more hot drink served on different airlines."
3382,Thanks.
3383,"Food quality at United has always been ""just OK"" but has made a BIG upswing in the past year!. Good on you."
3384,Chicken recipe was quite awful.
3385,The dinner rolls could be massively improved quite easily. the salad was also mediocre. the lemon sorbet was not ideal at all.
3386,No food served.
3387,no.
3388,No. Bot your voucher system socks!. $15 can not buy you a meal in almost any city!.
3389,No.
3390,I am so happy you are offering sparkling wine on most flights now. Thank you!.
3391,Portions of the Zatar chicken were very dry.
3392,No.
3393,No.
3394,"The cooked vegetable was so tough it impossible to cut, so I could not eat it [vegetable]. The polenta was delicious;. the chicken was average. I would have liked another soda."
3395,Do not thank you should be paying for lunch if the flight is at that time Raise the price of the fly by four dollars and give a free lunch like you used to.
3396,"No food offered. Not even peanuts. Which is fine, but why ask about food if you do not provide it [food]?."
3397,The quality and portion size was poor.
3398,I do not drink or eat when I fly.
3399,Business service was prompt and tailored to my request.
3400,Something little more healthy in snacks to purchase.
3401,Nope.
3402,Need more fruits and vegetables options.
3403,More choice of desserts.
3404,Main course was pretty average (soggy tortellini pasta). My buddy was in Business class. he got chicken curry. Chicken curry would have been much better than soggy pasta. Ice Cream was good.
3405,"I think 'less is more' with in-flight meals. It is hard to manage a lot of little plastic pots with limited elbow room, hot food always scalding, butter rock hard and ice cream half-melted. Plus the flavour was odd - burnt maybe?."
3406,I am happy I got a whole can of soda.
3407,No.
3408,Bagel was not available. The snack box we requested was not available. Did get a different snack box. It was good.
3409,No.
3410,"Previous pretzels and/or a cookie was offered. Now it is nothing. And honestly, flight are getting more and more expensive. It is not fair that you take away the small amenities."
3411,None.
3412,Bravo for adding AHA to your beverage lineup. Soda is out..... How about adding Ice tea?.
3413,Nothing. You should think more about warm food especially in long hour flights.
3414,Wine could be better.
3415,The cookies are awesome.
3416,Peets coffee would be improvement.
3417,No.
3418,No.
3419,Very clear but I like bread and butter.
3420,Breakfast was very bad. The eggs looked terrible. The pancakes were dry. The fruit was good.
3421,the sourbet was not freezed.
3422,Not bad for expect ions.
3423,Thank you.
3424,Please add vegetarian meal for those of us that do not eat meat.
3425,Thank you for the complementary drink.
3426,Salad quality was not good /fresh enough.
3427,Portion size was small.
3428,Pretty much ok.
3429,The Burger was dry and not hot.
3430,Just that the chicken was tough.
3431,N/A.
3432,I know it is a short flight but would be nice to get a water bottle when you board and a small snack.
3433,"the snack boxes offered were unappealing. The coffee and water were good, but (especially) the water was awkward to handle without spilling."
3434,No thanks.
3435,The beer options were extremely limited and tasteless.
3436,snacks should have been available.
3437,NO.
3438,Food selection was terrible. I picked Cheese It is which were stale. I expected much better flying First Class even for a shortened flight.
3439,An additional option in snacks would be nice -- but I understand that everything adds complexity.
3440,Better snack selection would be appreciated.
3441,More snack available.
3442,I wish United offered Miller lite or bud light.
3443,No regular beer on board.
3444,Excellent coffee and the new creamers are great. Way better than Starbucks in my opinion. Miss the biscuits with coffee. Maybe just out on my flight.
3445,Maybe offer a variety of chips.
3446,Everything was fantastic!. Service was fast and easy!.
3447,n/a.
3448,The food from LA to Narita was actually pretty good (both dinner and breakfast). The food from Narita to LA on United was not very good.
3449,"It is GREAT to have a few more beverage options. I would like to see the return of a caffeine free low sugar soda though, like Fresca."
3450,The food was great!!!. We would had the chicken before on a previous flight and did not love it but on this flight it was amazing (my Mom had it and let me taste it to point out the difference) and my meatball plate was awesome!!.
3451,Very tasty.
3452,None.
3453,Should include more salty snacks options.
3454,The ice cream served was already melted by the time it [ice cream] reached our tray.
3455,No.
3456,Beer.
3457,I ordered the gluten free meal. The option for dinner was very satisfactory. there was no option for the second meal service. Luckily I had brought my own snacks.
3458,Always leave the can.
3459,"I am Prem Econ would be good to have some kind of bubbles, or maybe a rose."
3460,The drink hit the spot!.
3461,"limited selection. snack was a sugary wafer, not healthy."
3462,I would like a Vegan low fat choice.
3463,Thank you for not having MSG and deveratives in the food.
3464,Is very good the attendance very professional excellent services.
3465,"There is NO caffeine free diet soda!!. Diet squirt, diet fresca, caffeine free diet mt. Dew, caffeine free Diet Coke … there are a lot of options and you seem to not care about a large majority of people who may be diabetic or watching their weight but want to be able to sleep once they get to their destination. This is a no brainer. No gluten free snacks for( pretzels and cookies) a gluten free granola bar may be a more expensive but you are actually discriminating against those with a food allergy."
3466,Liked the variety!.
3467,You need to give more verity for the deserts not only chocolate cookies.
3468,Wish pricing was better.
3469,Would be great to have more vegetarian/pescetarian options.
3470,Good was very good.
3471,I feel it has gone down since Covid.
3472,Was delicious.
3473,"the wine was poor, we tried a glass of red and a glass of red, both were unappealing and we finished neither."
3474,Biscoff and stroop waffles Should be on all flights!.
3475,"No, snacks missing on San Francisco to LA."
3476,The protein bowl for breakfast was confusing and not to my liking at all - it was also my only option.
3477,"If y'all ever get rid of those Biscoff cookies, it will be a sad day for United. Also giving me the entire can of soda goes a LONG way (and that is what happened on this flight). Previous attendants have split cans and that is frustrating."
3478,NA.
3479,Second meal with breakfast options the waffles were not good and parts of them were hard. First meal and sandwich were alright!.
3480,Thanks.
3481,The chicken is one of the best I have ever had in business class and the mashed potato is also good. It is on par with the meals served in Polaris Business Class.
3482,"I would like for United to bring the offer of complementary spirits during transatlantic flights. There was one snack offered was good quality, but no choice of snack. The dinner was quite good, although the breakfast was minimal."
3483,Was not offered water.
3484,just would have liked the water to come around about every hour.
3485,At check-in we were not given the opportunity to select our meal. We are flying first class. We were given this opportunity on the first leg of our flight from Washington DC to San Francisco. When it came to meal service we were given a chicken and a plant-based concoction which was awful.
3486,nice to have a breakfast service back.
3487,I wish the burger was available. The “desert” box had fairly small portions.
3488,Cookie with Carmel in the middle was great.
3489,Pleasantly impressed with the food.
3490,"Come on, guys. You can do better than the smallest pretzels imaginable."
3491,Dinner was fine except hard bread roll. The breakfast pizza was pretty bad and not eaten.
3492,Wish orange juice were 100% juice like juices on southwest flights.
3493,"There was no snack served on either of our flights. That may seem trite, but we do not bring on food, so the snack is a courtesy that is good for the airline to offer."
3494,You should offer the boxes to First class.
3495,Food service is nothing special on these flights even in first class.
3496,can not there be a snack?.
3497,What about offering a STROOPWAFFLE!. or those Biscotti cookies to go with the nice cup of tea that was served?.
3498,Was very limited.
3499,Would like more variety.
3500,"Tried two white wines. One was an acceptable Chardonnay. The other was unacceptable white wine, origin unknown, which was clearly oxidized and had an off flavor."
3501,They did not have sparkling water when it was the second drink service.
3502,Please bring back the biscuits and cinnamon rolls for breakfast in first class.
3503,More vegan options would be great. But we are happy to have the Tapas box. Especially when SFO food service workers are on strike!.
3504,Would rather have the Biscotti wafer.
3505,Too short for inflight food/beverages Frankfurt to SFO some of the food was not very warm.
3506,Plane boarding and than took off 1 hour past the time it was supposed to due to the cleaning crew cleaning the plane.
3507,Hot dish.
3508,Hamburger was great tasting.
3509,I miss the hot towel service !!.
3510,Why did we have a breakfast hot snack from ewr to pdx and nothing from pdx to ewr?.
3511,Why do not you have snacks anymore?.
3512,I like the new AHA sparkling water options. They are much healthier.
3513,would like to have had pretzels with the soda.
3514,The food was good. there were no choices left by the time we were served. Really hope any vegetarians get served first as the chicken option was the only thing available.
3515,nope.
3516,should charge little more to the tickets and give free snacks on the flights.
3517,Better food choices for coach.
3518,OK.
3519,Excelente.
3520,A snack would have been nice.
3521,"I ordered a special meal but did not receive it [meal]. There was a leftover meal I got. Also, when you sit in the back by the time they get to you there are no options left."
3522,"Nothing, it was rather a short flight and also a night time travel so no need for more food items."
3523,No.
3524,"The french toast and waffle options need some kind of meat too, otherwise. the meal is all carbs. At least offer it as an option. On the SFO-DC flights, there is not much other food (a meal is skipped because of time change) so more protein is needed even if you do not want eggs."
3525,United Express has planes too small to offer snacks or drinks other than water. Cabin crew is one person that did great. Our return to a Denver plane had a recorded safety message which allowed the one crew member to demonstrate as the message played. Another plan crew read the message & then demonstrated.
3526,"The choices of meals dwindle by the time you get to the back of first class. It is happened to me twice in the past. Once had to get something from the back offered for sale. It happened to our traveling companions on both legs of our flight from IAD to HNL. By the time they got to them no options were available and on the San Fran flight there was only tofu. We selected seats near the front, but United kept changing our flights and seats."
3527,"You need non- dairy items , at least in first class. I did not have dessert because everything had milk and cream."
3528,"I pre ordered a drink and snack but never received it. I did not think I would need to order it again, but the flight attendant never recognized that I pre ordered. If I made the effort to request the items, I would not think it would be necessary to ask again for them."
3529,Absolutley love United's coffee <:-)>.
3530,Did not get a sense how alcoholic beverages were to be ordered.
3531,Food is good.
3532,Very little portion.
3533,Mo.
3534,One cup?. Not much….
3535,The selections were not too appealing. the chicken dish was just ok.
3536,No.
3537,Good biscut.
3538,"I did not like the requirement to purchase refreshments only if you added a card to the United app. For that reason, I will not partake in anything other than complimentary snacks and beverages. Every person that I sat next to expressed the same sentiment."
3539,No.
3540,"It worked for me, especially on a 7am flight."
3541,"I usually drink Pepsi products, especially, diet Mountain Dew."
3542,I would like to see at least two choices of white and red wine. You can not alway be guaranteed good quality so a choice helps.
3543,I ordered the oatmeal for breakfast and it was delicious. The oatmeal was so much better than the oatmeal at the Four Season's. Please keep this breakfast on the menu. My husband was so jealous that my breakfast was better than his<😍>.
3544,Need to have more food options. Flew twice (1 international and 1 domestic)in a 2 week span and the food choices were exactly the same.
3545,"Would be great if they offered water more often or in larger quantities. It is very nice to hear them talking about recycling, as the small cups seem such a waste but necessary for the guests."
3546,"Please change the variety of the menu items. For frequent travelers, having the same menu items for many months makes for boring meals."
3547,Outstanding.
3548,"Was never offered a choice of snacks or beverages, only the products available for sale."
3549,Please have vegetarian food options.
3550,Minimum need 3 times to collect cups and wastes ( 2 times is not enough).
3551,I would have preferred a banana or some other fresh fruit to the options available.
3552,Maybe some other time.
3553,It would be nice if they served options with Nigeria foods .
3554,The bistro burger is fabulous. I had one on each flight and I can not stop raving about it. YUM.
3555,What has happened to the “snacks”?.
3556,no.
3557,Full can of soda offered and a second service of beverage was offered as well.
3558,Pasta was not so great. otherwise things were okay.
3559,Nano.
3560,I was in row 20. They were out of the Stroopwaffle before they got to me.
3561,No.
3562,"A recommendation for main meal.... why offer an ice-cream along with the hot dinner. The ice cream is melted 90%+ by the time you get to it. Some years back, Ice cream was offered when they would pick up the trays. Perfect way to enjoy. The food offered on Landing in Chicago is rather a sad example of a snack/meal. It is just a hot sandwich with a slap of cheese & some ham)."
3563,"I realize how hard it is to feed so many people on an airplane, but if you could improve on overall taste of the food, that would increase my likelihood of choosing United first."
3564,Would have preferred the option to pre-order my meal but could not figure out if I could or not. I had no trouble pre-ordering my meal for the 1st leg of the trip. I could only see snack choices.
3565,I had requested gluten-free but for some reason it did not get added to my seat assignment. So no meal for me.
3566,"The quality of the food and service has been slipping. There is a big difference now from just a year or two ago, certainly from before Covid. Whilst it is understood That most flights are understaffed from the desired level, the premade food has a lot to be desired about. Also beverage service is very hurried. you never get asked if you want a refill."
3567,As mentioned earlier we could not select vergetarian / vergan meals at the United App ahead a time.
3568,Keep it simple.
3569,No.
3570,Chopin vodka is preferred.
3571,No pre-flight beverage service offered. Was disappointed as I paid for this upgrade;. on my flight home i did not pay for it. the did offer the service.
3572,There was no meal on the flight at 5:17pm. The brands of alcohol are not good.
3573,Water soda.
3574,We were told it would be limited. agent suggested we buy something in the airport. This was surprising to hear.
3575,Have meals without nuts seeds and cream sauce!. Simple healthy and nut free and gluten free is easy to offer.
3576,Taking debit cards would help a lot.
3577,"United needs more than 2 or 3 Bailey & Cream's and we need a Canadian Whiskey, it does not have to be Crown, but Canadian Club or Seagrams would be nice."
3578,Please provide more snacks for basic economy customers.
3579,I wish there had NOT been red peppers in the eggs. She said there was ham and cheese...
3580,Surprised beverages were not free for Economy Plus and Premier Platinum member.
3581,I think premium economy selection felt less different to standard economy than other airlines I fly.
3582,Roll supposed to accompany dinner was not provided.
3583,No.
3584,No I was very satisfied.
3585,"Water was warm. I was not recognized as a 1K (second flight in a row I was not recognized), therefore my snack or drink were not offered."
3586,I do not expect anything for this very short fight's.
3587,"I know it is not a standard route, but given that many passengers from TLV keep Kosher, it would be nice in the business class section to keep some kosher sandwiches or other non-junk food available."
3588,No.
3589,"as in my earlier comments, the first meal was good, the second was terrible, as was the decision to offer ""breakfast"" [either waffles or bagel/lox] for later afternoon landing at EWR that bordered on inedible."
3590,"A beverage was not offered with the dinner. Beverages were offered pre-flight and with the breakfast, also when requested. Other than that service was fine."
3591,I wish there were more vegetarian options.
3592,"Disappointed in first class meal service. There were little to no options - a lack of creative preparation - and the presentation was little more than what used to be served in economy seating. Recent flights on both Delta and America First Class were different experiences. more options, better creative menus, service utensils and dishes were of higher quality. snack service was much more frequent on long flights with a variety of types and sizes. Very little interaction with United flight attendants on the long haul after meal was served. I have great appreciation for United - it is my choice. On the most recent flight I was disappointed only in meal service and options. All other parts of the flight experience were excellent."
3593,No.
3594,No snacks provided. beverage options were limited or none.
3595,No beverages at all served.
3596,"Inconsistent. We had 3 flights that day. All flights we ordered sparkling water/clubs soda. First one my wife and i were each given a can. Second flight the row ahead of us each got a can of soda, my wife and i got a poured glass with ice. Neither of us literally had a single mouthful of soda in the glass. Third flight we were given a can to split between us. Not a big deal, just inconsistent."
3597,No.
3598,more no sugar options.
3599,Bigger snacks.
3600,Grandchildren with me wanted apple juice and did not have. Odd as this seems a staple.
3601,You should offer free alcoholic drinks to those individuals who upgrade to Premium Plus.
3602,The pasta had a fishlike smell which as off putting. The rest of the flight food & beverage service was fine. Thank you. B.
3603,The food was excellent.
3604,Pancakes served with a hot compote that was so hot I dropped it over my clothes.
3605,Biscoff and strupfwaffle is played out after 5+ years. Portion of pretzels is a joke.
3606,Time to roll out better food and beverage optikns.
3607,Wished bistro menu was available.
3608,"The price of the ticket should include a better snack, something suitable for an adult."
3609,I am happy the flight attendant told of the pre-order feature…I was not aware on that.
3610,The food quality is behind both what United used to offer pre-pandemic and other large carriera.
3611,"I would like United to have Squirt soft drink in bottles, please."
3612,Can we have nuts and sundaes?.
3613,None.
3614,"We preordered our meals but were told on board that the system was not working and since we were in the 3rd row, of 3, not all options were available."
3615,The meal choices were not what I preferred. A sandwich would have been better.
3616,Bigger bags.
3617,Chicken was dry and very salty.
3618,"It was an odd salad type with couscous or barley, not appetizing looking so I only ate my roll and main and dessert."
3619,My first two food choices were both unavailable. Seems like a better job could be done ensuring adequate choices.
3620,Still need to improve overall quality of food in business. For multi thousand dollar tickets you can and should do better.
3621,Portions were light.
3622,More sugar free options.
3623,The snacks were fine but not really a snack.
3624,None.
3625,No.
3626,焼きそばが期待していたものとは少し違って残念.
3627,I did not expect to receive food or beverages on the flight and was pleasantly surprised at getting a whole can of club soda given to me (without having to ask for the whole can) plus a package of cookies. Yay!.
3628,Muy rica la comida.
3629,I like you have the option of white claws on the fight. I just wish there was another warm dish as an option for as late as the flight was.
3630,"During various recent flights I tried to order a cocktail / spirits but was told that there was beer and wine only. Especially on the 2 international flights to AMS this year, this was quite a disappointment. No real explanation was given by the FA's."
3631,We did not realize there was a free meal until after we asked for water. Thought it was a beverage cart. Never heard a message about an actual meal. Only that we could pay for alcohol. Which we were only allowed to buy one. First class gets to buy more. Not sure why that is the case. Made me feel like you do not trust people in main cabin to handle their alcohol. Poor form truly.
3632,Meal needs dressing. Dry lettuce is terrible. A warm option would be better. Diet caffeine free soda would be great. Diet sprite.
3633,Very much appreciate the snack and drink offered to 1K members.
3634,More flavours.
3635,"You always used to get a snack like Biscoff, pretzels, etc. The flight to and back from Philadelphia had none. Very disappointing. If this is a cost savings ploy, a lot of people are talking and enjoyed that little snack."
3636,I wish I had the whole can. I was thirsty very thirsty. Great snacks just not enough.
3637,None.
3638,"Entree was fine. I wish there were more diet. caffeine free soft drinks available. The turkey and cheese sandwich on a pretzel roll was awful. It has been awful from the day United started serving them as a snack before landing a while back, and continues to leave much to be desired."
3639,The Thai chicken curry that was served on my flight was outstanding - almost certainly the best meal I have ever had on an airplane!.
3640,Enough snacks on board to be given both options.
3641,Great breakfast.
3642,"The chicken was out. the beef was substituted with pork. I believe the fish was also out. I ended up with the vegetarian option which would normally be okay, except it contain a tomato sauce. I was specially advised by my gastroenterologist to avoid tomatoes. My stomach was off for the remaining 6 hours of the flight..."
3643,No.
3644,Was traveling with little children. Might be nice to have more selection for them.
3645,Unfortunately no snacks at all or food offered.
3646,Need other sugar-free choices. Coke Zero/ light is the only option.
3647,One biscuit on a four hour flight is rather meager.
3648,Selection was very limited.
3649,no.
3650,Better than food and beverage on flight from Chicago to Dublin.
3651,Lunch came with butter. I assume that was intended to be used with something bread-like. No one got bread or a dinner roll with their lunch. Seems like a waste of butter. Perhaps the butter was meant to go on the spinach and rice. That did not occur to me on the flight.
3652,No service due to conditions.
3653,Only one beverage offered for the entire flight. Water close to landing would have been very appreciated.
3654,There was option to preorder a meal on this flight. the choice left much to be desired. Chicken or vegetable burger. Gross.
3655,A more substantial snack would be appreciated.
3656,I was not offered a beverage during my flight in first class.
3657,"Never got an opportunity for a second beverage I would have purchased a double but your current policy is some sort of BS about “keeping masks on” as the reasoning behind only allowing one alcoholic beverage to be purchased at a time even tho \<20% of flight was masked, flight attendants not masked… makes less than zero sense. Also, paid for economy plus but still charged for a drink in spite of delay. Double lame (pun intended)."
3658,N/A.
3659,The cheese sandwich landing snack was forgettable.
3660,"Put my card information into the app prior to leaving Minot, but it was not available to the flight attendant once on the plane."
3661,"Appearance of brioche burger not good. Would be good to have lettuce, tomato."
3662,Wish there had been more to offer as the flight was close to meal time. It is a shame that we now have to purchase food in addition to the price of our flight.
3663,I would like more variety.
3664,"The Indian entree, chicken tikka, was very tasty and not overly spicy."
3665,The for sale packages have not changed in months. Some greater variety would be desirable.
3666,Wish water was offered more.
3667,Keep the biscoff cookies.
3668,A snack would have been nice. Water and a candy or small snack would be a nice improvement.
3669,No snacks were served.
3670,Diet Dr Pepper or Fresca should be carried. Seltzer I got was fine. Could have used food snack eg pretzels.
3671,Very lovely service.
3672,Food.
3673,All was very good.
3674,I have flown this route for more than 5 years. the choices do not appear to have changed (chicken dish or pasta dish). The bread with the meal is hard as a rock;. consider changing your source or the choice of bread.
3675,"It would have been nice if we were offered choices like in the past, prepandemic."
3676,Not.
3677,I was able to purchase food on the plane that I was not allowed to purchase 3 days before the flight.
3678,Chicken was dry and unappetizing. Fruit was great. Need low sugar desserts/pastries.
3679,"Should have some sugar free items, diabetic."
3680,no.
3681,More beer/alcohol choices would be better. There was only 3 beer options.
3682,Have to pay for cheese and crackers?. Seriously?.
3683,Tasted like packaged food. Not like food pre Covid. Poor quality.
3684,"We ordered hamburgers online from the email that we received and were only offered a vegetarian and SPICY pasta dish and not the hamburger. I can not eat spicy things. I am not into vegetarian so my husband ate my dinner. I went hungry. Not enough choices onboard and if you offer things online and we choose that, why did not we get it?. Not satisfied with the options and lack of."
3685,More options of food & beverage (non-alcoholic) would be nice.
3686,"For the price we pay for tickets, why anyone is only presented with just a cup of beverage rather than a full can/bottle of desired drink is ridiculous."
3687,"Quality far below Asian and Euro lines… it is to be expected?. Especially lounge is poor in comparison, but getting better of late."
3688,A better more hearty transcon meal even at a higher ticket price is better than separate charges.
3689,Would prefer to have both pretzels and cookie.
3690,Very fresh and delicious fruit as part of the meal.
3691,Had Lasagna it was nice and hot salad was good too .
3692,Glad to see snacks served after recent SEA-ORD trip on which there were NO snacks served in coach.
3693,No meal service and all business class customers were promised $50 voucher via email. To date nothing has come thru yet.
3694,The staff offered free snacks at the gate due to the flight delay. This was appreciated. Thank you.
3695,"On my most recent flight, and other international flights with United, I did not know what kind of chicken dish was available. The choices were chicken or veggie. Last time it was a chicken curry. this flight was a chicken tomato quinoa dish. I will make sure to ask, but it may be helpful to add one adjective to the chicken option when presenting to customers."
3696,Preorder should be utilized more. I believe this is preferred to being on a flight with options limited (connecting flight just before this would have benefitted from preorder;. entire section was unable to order beef because there were not enough beef meals).
3697,Nop.
3698,Will we be able to pre-order specialty meals again?. Will mixed drinks be available?.
3699,The meal was very good.
3700,I fly with you frequently and wish there were more options as I tire of the same items 3-4 times/month.
3701,Would appreciate to have more snack variety other than pretzels or cookies.
3702,"I am sorry, it was not this flight but your survey would not let me go back. It was other legs of my trip. All flights need at least pretzels or cookies for those of us who need something to chew for our ears."
3703,Impressed by the full size can of soda. Expected one of the small cans.
3704,Would have been nice to have pretzels or peanuts.
3705,Good.
3706,"My beverage choice was not available. Flight attendant said he would check in back, but never returned. Tho I did have something else meanwhile so not terrible."
3707,For first class should offer a little bit better.
3708,Would prefer being served can of soda or sparkling water instead of just a cup.
3709,No - the chicken curry dish & endive salad were very good!.
3710,For some reason no one in my section got there second meal...looked like crap anyway.
3711,Tea had a strange flavor.
3712,The food options were poor. Not much to choose from.
3713,They were yummy.
3714,A continental breakfast in first class should definitely be classier.
3715,It would be nice to pre-order because my first two options were not available.
3716,The pre-order was not what was loaded on the flight.
3717,No snack.
3718,"Prefer more nutritious boxed options than the junk offered. Ie, cheese/crackers/ grapes/humus."
3719,Time to change the snack Options.
3720,"Initial meal was served within an hour after take-off and subsequent meal was served approx an hour before landing, that is at least 8-9 hours in between meals and made the trip uncomfortable."
3721,no.
3722,No.
3723,They were out of Stoopwaffels.
3724,Flight was too quick for it.
3725,"No, not really."
3726,Really glad to be able to get the fruit flavored sparking water- AHA.
3727,I prefer to drink Dr Pepper rather than Coke.
3728,None.
3729,I pre- ordered for the first time but did not receive my orders.
3730,I would have like a little larger snack.
3731,"I had a vegetarian meal which consisted of rice and vegetables twice on an 11-hour flight... do not get me wrong, it was okay, but could have been a bit more better (diversify)."
3732,There are very few options for the vegetarians. Only have a choice between Tapas or recline boxes!.
3733,It would be nice if a small snack was provided.
3734,Better sandwich variety on the way back.
3735,Food really needs improvement. For the price of the ticket you can not even offer a choice of a sandwich when going coast to coast. Your International food at best boardline and truly not at enough for a 9 hour flight.
3736,Would prefer pepsi to be an option as do not enjoy coke products or sprite. Very limited options. Meal was served on a cold bowl meaning the food went cold super quick. Bread roll was hard. Was unable to eat before landing as they has run out of my first and only choice.
3737,Drink options are fine. Food choices continue to be subpar.
3738,I think the last flight from Sydney to LA a month ago the food options were better no warm nuts on this service and not really good bread service or appetizer and dessert.
3739,Need to change up the menu. It is been the same on this flight for a long time.
3740,Better breakfast and or lunch.
3741,No.
3742,I was happy United served Coke products.
3743,None. The beverages were good for the flight.
3744,no snack was a little disappointed over that. love my snacks.
3745,Selections too limited.
3746,"Small snack would be great, better quality of wine Coffee was great!."
3747,I had one beverage service on this flight and ordered water. That was just right for me.
3748,"Need food items that are not gas causing. So much beans, cheese and hard to digest."
3749,No.
3750,Will use United at Newark again.
3751,I was not given a choice. I got a bag of pretzels the passenger beside me got cookies and pretzels. Not cool.
3752,There was no food and beverage on this 1 hour flight.
3753,It would be nice to have small sandwiches Drinks were great.
3754,No.
3755,I was glad to see snacks and a variety of drinks served. And on some flights we were even offered a choice of snacks. Thank you!.
3756,Not happy that Bombay is the only choice of gin.
3757,The chicken satay was terrible. the flight attendant made up for poor quality. He was awesome. Can not remember his name.
3758,Did not have beverages.
3759,Bring back peanuts.
3760,The wine was dreadful.
3761,Prefer bottled water over a glass.
3762,I was extremely impressed with the pasta ravioli how generous the portion was and absolutely delicious!. Airplane food should not be so good!.
3763,"no--actually if your survey would give the option of NA or did not purchase it would be a lot nicer than going through and selecting ""i did not purchase..."" three times to get to this point."
3764,More choice would be nice.
3765,You ran out of beer on this flight as well. How can you not properly stock the plane with beverages for such a long flight?!.
3766,Non sugar options would be nice.
3767,NA.
3768,"Only thing I would share is that if someone orders a soda, especially a diet one, just give them the can. Not many people do, and they go flat so fast. I asked for a Diet Coke and The attendant gave me the half that was left over from someone else and it was flat. Just a thought."
3769,None.
3770,More snacks next time plz.
3771,I was only offered one entree and for some reason everyone else was offered two. I would have loved the offer of one more beverage. My connecting flight had dramatically better service.
3772,We were served throughout not just once.
3773,The Belgium waffle was DELICIOUS!!.
3774,The only suggested improvement on the food/beverages is to have a better quality of coffee.
3775,"As much as we are paying for tickets, the snacks that were offered were terrible and do not take into consideration people with food allergies."
3776,Serve a bit bigger portion of the snacks.
3777,The veg entree lacked veggies…. too few and lots of noodles.
3778,No.
3779,Offer a low carb alternative like nuts. Junk food in the am is not a good idea.
3780,"We use to have much better quality of wine. Now, it is pretty ordinary. Presentation is mediocre to say the least."
3781,"I am gluten free. although I did not request a meal, the lunch did not have any fruit of vegetables and little protein."
3782,I think united should offer more food choices if purchasing ahead of the flight rather than just the same basic snacks you can buy on the plane.
3783,coffee was good.
3784,Nothing was offered because it was a short flight.
3785,Slow going with new attendant.
3786,serve the drinks first and than the snack.
3787,None.
3788,Braised beef great.
3789,I thought the blue cup with United on it was a good idea...matching.
3790,No.
3791,No snack provided.
3792,no.
3793,"No, nothing."
3794,No.
3795,Would have been nice to have been offered small snack/cookies.
3796,Service was great.
3797,Was just odd that our flight down to Cancun we had the option for pretzels or a cookie and this flight did not have that.
3798,no complain.
3799,That is all.
3800,There were no free snacks offered.
3801,Everything fine.
3802,Food or beverage was not offer on this flight.
3803,better variety of food and larger portions of beverages.
3804,"Food was not that great. I believe there are 30 seats in business and they were only four servings of fish. If you offer three items, you would think United would have at least 1/3 of each. For the price of the ticket, your food really is pretty awful. And when are you going to acknowledge gluten intolerance?."
3805,No.
3806,One of the best flight meals I have ever had.
3807,No.
3808,Did not really want a beverage so did not order. Would have been nice to have a snack option also.
3809,I would like to eat tasty food or snack.
3810,No.
3811,A free snack like pretzels would have been nice!.
3812,Would have liked a snack such as nuts or crackers.
3813,Std beverages.
3814,New vendor is recommended.
3815,The fish was amazingly good!.
3816,My husband had the chicken dish and loved it. Said he would order it in a restaurant.
3817,was not offered.
3818,No.
3819,The breakfast was poor. Who eats scrambled eggs with fried plantains. Bad choice.
3820,Not really. I enjoyed every thing.
3821,none.
3822,The flight attendants were very attentive in serving.
3823,No.
3824,it is difficult to please individuals but I suspect that the closeness of the seating makes any meal difficult to enjoy. p.
3825,"In general, I wish you would minimize your use of single use plastics. Water (and other drinks)in cartons or cans, compostable instead of plastic utensils, compostable cups instead of plastic. And I really hope you reuse those head phones that you give out in first class."
3826,"For the last 4 flight I had with United (this year), the meal options were always chicken or pasta (vegetarian). They both come with the heavy tomato sauce, which is not very pleasant. So if you do not like this sauce, you do not get much choice. Also it would be great to have just one more tea option, aside from black. Like mint or or any other non caffeine tea. Thank you."
3827,Business needs more than pretzels no matter how short.
3828,One package of 2 small cookies is a bit meager. When the stewardess was asked if we could have a package of pretzels as well she said she could not because there was not enough to go around.
3829,Good.
3830,No.
3831,No.
3832,Allow for one free cocktail on international flights in economy plus.
3833,Very Good.
3834,"Wish that we could be offered a small water bottle during shorter flights, good weather permitting."
3835,"Complimentary water in my view, should alway be served in a small bottle and never in a plastic cup. Not on a plane."
3836,"I do not expect a huge selection. But it would be nice if the flight attendants came around more often, since I could not get out of my seat."
3837,Maybe more variety.
3838,Need non-alcoholic beer.
3839,schedule integrity is most important consideration.
3840,Please please get smarter on allergies - more gluten free marked options please - 1% of the Northern Europe population is gluten allergic / coeliac - I think you fly enough passengers that that is a lot of people and yet there are zero options. I have a wheat allergy - serious and yet on United I am regularly given the wrong food. you have to get better at this!!.
3841,Decent selection of beverages. Limited choice of snacks.
3842,No.
3843,"For Polaris, the a la carte sundae was always something to look forward to on long flights. No other dessert option that I have tried is at all appealing. Bring back the hot fudge sundae!. Also, more premium champagne/sparkling wine options are necessary. Other airlines' premium cabins have excellent champagne and United has really fallen behind here."
3844,The food service is still dramatically worse on Polaris Business than the old business class dining. It is really disappointing.
3845,More sparkling water choices.
3846,I appreciated that the wine was complimentary.
3847,"The beef entree was not great, but definitely edible. My neighbour got the fish and it looked much better, and a bigger portion. I did not ask how it tasted, but she at it all. The cheese plate arrived and all the cheeses were same / similar, and hard / dry like they had been left out, or stored, too long."
3848,"The staff was awesome. However, they gave us the ice cream before they served the food. It was a melted mess by the time I was ready for dessert."
3849,"Horrible bun , hard to understand specially when you leave Germany that has the best in the world."
3850,i would like to see drinks served in more sustainable options such as compostable cups (ie like bamboo) rather than single use plastics.
3851,The food for business class was delicious.
3852,"I had a dinner which was average at best. I do not expect gourmet on a flight, ibut it was rather bland, and I am very easy to please."
3853,No.
3854,The selection of food should meet more healthy standards or people who care about their diet. My wife is Vegan. she was not able to eat since nothing fit her desired requirement for vegan.
3855,Flight was delayed (very slightly) as we were waiting for the food to arrive/be loaded. The food when served seemed very fresh and appetising. Although as usual the salad was an odd combination and inedible.
3856,not enough options such as vegan snacks. there was no ginger ale.
3857,The meal had a spicy sauce. An option of the sauce on the side would be nice.
3858,7:30am flight and the only offerings were pretzels and some packaged waffle thing. Perhaps the bishoff biscuit should have been available for a morning flight.
3859,Better champagne please.
3860,No.
3861,No.
3862,Love the Stroopwafels.
3863,United (and quite frankly most US based carriers) lack the quality of most foreign carriers. (And the menus in Polaris class need.
3864,"There should be an allotment of additional kosher meals on flights to and from Tel Aviv. it is rather absurd to have an exact amount, as the app is not sufficient to know and determine kosher meals. Additionally, there was no red kosher wine. these flights are better than 50% kosher;. do not be stingy, especially with business class customers paying in excess of $5,000 for the RT flight."
3865,Breakfast instead cake should be a bread or crossaint.
3866,Not enough non-meat choices.
3867,la calidad de la comida fue altamente superior en el vuelo de EZE-IAH que en el de regreso IAH-EZE.
3868,"It would be nice to receive a small snack for the flight, as well as sparkling water options."
3869,No.
3870,nice if you had a good red wine.
3871,It would have been nice to have drinks service but it is a short flight.
3872,The tea was terrible.
3873,"Cheese plate...which you typically have, was not available."
3874,Morning snack was yogurt and a very sweet biscotti. Hot breakfast sandwich would have been preferred.
3875,"My husband and I pre-ordered vegetarian meals. my husband did not receive his breakfast like I did. I am glad that the breakfast option handed out to the rest of the passengers was vegetarian friendly for him to eat. The salad portions with out main meal were tiny. the asian vegetarian meal was delicious as always. Also, I am glad that the flight attendant gave us sorbet ice anyways because the cookie that we received with our dinner just was not cutting it. Also, the last couple long-haul flights I have been on this year never seem to have the hazy ipa that is listed in the beverage card. I would recommend either removing it from the card or making sure that the plane is stocked with the beer. Having a quality craft beer on the flight just sounds like a great way to start a journey."
3876,I think a hot meal should always be provided on international flights. This flight only has a meal in one direction which is confusing because the return flight is the same length and more expensive.
3877,"With this flight being over 5 hours, I think having a more substantial food like a sandwich should be offered."
3878,"On a flight of this length, there needs to be more drink service (barring any interruptions caused by turbulence). In dry air like this, two drinks simply is not enough, and I would have been extremely uncomfortable if I had not brought drinks with me."
3879,Taste of veg meals may be improved. More variety may be added.
3880,All I wanted to say was everything was ok except the bread rolls need to be thawed properly and slightly heated. Otherwise all ok.
3881,It offered a snack in coach.
3882,Too spicy and a bit strange tasing chicken.
3883,I wish you had offered a low carb snack like peanuts instead of just pretzels and cookies.
3884,Our preorder was for a breakfast entree that was apparently substituted that day. The French toast I was served was good.
3885,Thanks for always providing snacks and drinks.
3886,Tomato juice.
3887,Should be at no cost to the flying pubilic.
3888,No.
3889,No complimentary snack on flight to San Fran.
3890,Did not eat on the Newark to Tampa flight. Did not have a glass of wine becausr we did not like choices.
3891,So nice to get a “real” meal again. I can not it was a good value though considering it was an $8 burger which is not a tremendous value when paying the price for a fist class upgrade. Happy nonetheless.
3892,A whole can of soda for long trip. Bigger complimentary snack for long flight.
3893,Could we pls get a new dessert option ?. The chocolate chip cookie is awesome but getting a little old <:)>.
3894,The chicken was spicy.
3895,"We were not offered enough water, important for a 10.5 hour flight. generally the flight attendants did a good job. I would have appreciated a salad with the lunch."
3896,Did not seem to be a good value for the snack's.
3897,No.
3898,"I have never gotten more than the two standard options;. although the meals are delicious, this gets tedious across a total of four flights in a short amount of time."
3899,Lilly coffee was a nice touch.
3900,"Please have more gluten-free, non-meat options."
3901,No.
3902,the waffles were soggy. Not sure it is a great idea to serve waffles with fruit on top.
3903,A healthy snack choice like nuts would be nice.
3904,Better variety of snacks and beverage.
3905,Food could be better.
3906,Just very hurried due to turbulence.
3907,Something other than pretzels would be a welcomed change.
3908,Should be able to pre-order meal on transcontinental flight.
3909,Fantastic to get a selection of snacks in addition to the snack box!!.
3910,No ice for drinks.
3911,No.
3912,On flight to Vegas. Snack offered was “Sweet cookie” or plain cookie. ?. A little vague trying to determine what they were especially seating in window seat.
3913,"No, it was fine."
3914,"The frequency they came to offer. And the flight from shv to IAH, nothing was offered."
3915,"The selections of both red and white wines were disappointing. There was no Chardonnay, and the whites were not appealing. The red was ok. No Cabernet red wines. For an international business class, the wine was disappointing."
3916,No.
3917,Offer up some complementary spirits at least on international flights.
3918,Have warm foods.
3919,"For an international business class meal, the quality of the food served should be better."
3920,Wish there were more options than stale pretzels - biscoffs are always great. I would like to have coffee or tea but do not trust the water heaters are regularly cleaned to drink it. the sodas were flat. Also different water than Dasani.
3921,No.
3922,Everything was great I am very happy with what I get.
3923,Welcome more variety. Would be great having limes/lemons back.
3924,Coffee was not great. I am used to bottle water on delta and not having to ask for a refill often. I drink a lot of water.
3925,No.
3926,"The serving trays in which the meals are delivered on are poorly designed with the chair trays. The food tray kept sliding down the chair's food tray, making it difficult to eat and less enjoyable experience."
3927,Served cookie. Available sugar free.
3928,should have additional selections.
3929,Larger portions.
3930,My only comment is that it would be awfully nice if you could give folks a reasonable amount of pretzels. The package we ate could not have been more than 1 ounce<:(>.
3931,Great on this flight in first class but on SEA-ORD flight in coach I felt United was “cheap” in eliminating snacks in coach. Bad for reputation!!!!!.
3932,More variety of snacks would be good and in a larger size.
3933,I would like small bottle water.
3934,They do not serve snacks only drinks.
3935,I would like to see the return to pre Covid food service.
3936,thank you.
3937,Hoping for a few more salad and sandwich options in the future. The coast to coast flights with a time difference make it difficult to adequately eat.
3938,No.
3939,The coffee pot was broken on this flight at 7:30am.
3940,I would like to have a snack provided by United.
3941,The staff were very attentive. I had a 3 year old child with me. I had a great experience.
3942,We had a snack on the way that was good. Tapas. no meat. that is important to offer that option.
3943,No preorder was available.
3944,It would be nice to have some savory breakfast.
3945,"It would be nice to have less plastics, f.e. could the „glasses“ be refilled."
3946,"In addition to drink service, was given the snack bag (pretzels, small water bottle and stoopwaffle). Would have been less wasteful just to offer the snack basket to select item(s) from and omit the plastic bag and accompanying items. The pretzels tasted slightly stale."
3947,Next time I will try the burger but for this flight due to recent unforseen dental surgery I was limited.
3948,Please offer more choices. Add sandwiches for purchase.
3949,Cabernet wine was not very good.
3950,Pretzels (that tasted stale) or a cookie?. Those were my only choices.
3951,No.
3952,"When being given water on flight, I would like a full bottle. I do not want my drink to spill. I do not want to ask for refills. just being given a full bottle (with cap) would be the best option."
3953,Cold water or water with ice would be more comfortable to drink then room temperature water.
3954,No.
3955,I did not have any.
3956,Just a wake up when food and drinks are coming by.
3957,would have liked more options esp with kids. Size could have been bigger.
3958,No.
3959,"I loved getting a can of pop but I did not see that it would was recycled, which I would expect. I also am unsure why an additional cup with ice is necessary, when it would be nice just to have the beverage be cold instead."
3960,The egg white and kale breakfast was amazing and please keep it on the menu!. Please offer a premium wine selection as a up charge if possible. Thx.
3961,Needed a snack.
3962,N/a.
3963,Would like to start getting better options included with the flight.
3964,Would be nice if hot meals were offered to coach passengers for pay (#bringbackthecheeseburger). : ).
3965,Keep trying;. but should be upgraded in Business Class on a 777.
3966,"I had the same meals offered over the course of four flights in two months. Perhaps, a slightly different selection would be possible."
3967,None.
3968,The fofdvwas grest.
3969,.
3970,It would be great if you could offer low carb snacks on the flight.
3971,Nothing.
3972,No.
3973,"All is fine, maybe more porción of cookies."
3974,"The flight attendants came 3 times to ask us what we wanted to drink, that is amazing, I am pregnant and I am really thirsty all the time, so that was awesome, so again thank you for your excellent service <😃>."
3975,The dessert option was ice cream but it was served with the meal and therefore liquid when ready for it. Poor choice unless you serve it after the meal.
3976,Wine was mediocre. Chicken was bland and tasteless. Bread roll was cold and hard. Vegetable side was salty and soggy.
3977,The beverage menu clearly stays there is brut sparkling wine but the flight attendant acted like she never heard of it and said they did not have it.
3978,I was very impressed with the food presentation. The meal was very tasty. served nice and hot. The wine was good too.
3979,Disappointed no free snacks were offered during beverage service.
3980,no.
3981,More selections. Only a choice of a chicken dish or vegetarian.
3982,Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meals provided in premium plus. Keep it up!.
3983,"Seems like a lot of polenta, it [polenta] tasted too salty for me."
3984,"I was on 4 flights in a week. There was no variety in choices. On my flight from Denver to San Diego, I ate the same meal as my flight from Boston to Denver. There needs to be more variety."
3985,Better brewed coffee.
3986,Very enjoyable and again the attendents were very cordial and professional. Tx Valentine.
3987,The meals could be better.
3988,I would have liked Dr Pepper.
3989,The box I paid for the food was stale. the pretzels were gross.
3990,First class food was substandard.
3991,No.
3992,No.
3993,3.5 hour flight something more sustantial.
3994,The seats were ok not very relaxing.
3995,No.
3996,Pancakes and eggs were cold and rubbery. Did not taste good at all. Dinner was great on other hand.
3997,Wish there was an option to see ahead of time what was going to be served and what was in the food. So many have dietary issues today. It is hard to quickly choose when you only know your 2 options as the flight attendant is asking you in the moment.
3998,"we are typically disappointed with the wine selection with united. however, some of the international airlines seem to have a better selection."
3999,N/A.
4000,A sandwich or other food would be helpful.
4001,Before we traveled I got an email asking if I wanted to purchase food. Kind of miss leading you do not know if you are getting a snack and a beverage for free so you do not know what to do.
4002,The shaker salad I ordered was partially frozen. I should have returned it [salad]. the flight attendants were so busy I did not want to bother them.
4003,No water was offered as we sat on runway before flight was canceled.
4004,The water was room temperature on all flights which is not appealing. Some flight attendants will give a glass of ice. some not.
4005,No.
4006,I had a transatlantic flight. Our food was very tasty for airplane food.
4007,A bigger bag of pretzels or 2 of the little bags ea.?.
4008,None was served on that flight that I can remember.
4009,Oatmeal and Thai chicken were good.
4010,I love the Biscotti.
4011,Wish breakfast items had been offered since it was a morning flight.
4012,Nope.
4013,The gluten free meal service and attitude of the attendants was much better on our Porto to Newark light compared to the Newark to Porto flight.
4014,"Good, wish there were more food options for longer flights."
4015,I was pleasantly surprised by the meal offered. It was healthy and delicious.
4016,Better options of snack.
4017,"You could do a lot better, your food is eadeble but just that, you are far from having the WOW factor."
4018,Survey covers it well. I believe the quality of food and or beverages continues to improve.
4019,Seat has no holder for drinks.
4020,Salad was a bit dry.
4021,I had much better vegetarian food on other airlines.
4022,It was surprisingly good. Enjoyed every bite.
4023,no.
4024,"Hated that the only way to purchase items was by having preloaded your credit card number in the app. I had, so it was not a problem for me personally, but for older travelers or those not as tech savvy, this feels almost discriminating. An older gentleman in front of me was refused service b/c of this issue, and he seemed quite embarrasses. That should NOT happen. Even American Airlines offers pretzels or cookies."
4025,Offer different chicken dishes please. I am so sick of Zaatar chicken. which I have had on several flights in the past couple months.
4026,I already mentioned no snacks were served.
4027,no.
4028,"Need to have more variety, like fruits, yogurts for morning flights. Variety of teas would also be helpful."
4029,"The only 2 options were curry chicken. I love chicken but not curry. The other option was crispy tofu, which was really mushy tofu. I did not eat it."
4030,The food had flavor and was better than expected.
4031,Dinner was tasteless. Roll was hard.
4032,The tortellini Rossi was absolutely delicious. My wife had the chicken peri peri and it was too spicy.
4033,no.
4034,They served a different scotch then what was listed.
4035,The chicken was really good but the bed of whatever it was sitting on was not very good. I never could figure out what it was.
4036,The vegetarian option was excellent.
4037,I feel like the flight attendants should know that we prepurchased something.
4038,I would prefer if you offered Pepsi brand.
4039,Thanks for offering complimentary drinks on the flight.
4040,No.
4041,Tea with milk.
4042,Appreciate having the services provided and not having to wear masks!!!!!.
4043,n/a.
4044,Dinner was just a salad. breakfast was very disappointing as who eats cold chic peas for breakfast!.
4045,It just seems that since the pandemic the food and beverage service and quality has gone downhill.
4046,Happy to see that the pandemic is behind and that regular food service can now go on as usual in Business Class.
4047,The ability to simply order fresh fruit or a fully gluten free/grain free snack would be appreciated.
4048,It was great.
4049,"A small complimentary snack, such as chips or a cookie, would have been easy to dispense by flight attendant, and would have provided a small energy boost at a minimal cost to United."
4050,I had an econ + seat on this flight. Prior to covid a meal service was provided on transcon routes for those with econ + seats. It was something I always looked forward to. I was unaware prior to this flight that the meal service was no longer provided and was extremely disappointed. I hope this will be reinstated soon as possible.
4051,I think United can do better with the food. I do not choose an airline based on food but I have had better meals on other airlines.
4052,No.
4053,Food was terrible.
4054,"Why not make the food options actually affordable?. An entire value meal costs $10. yet a little sandwich on the plane is same cost. Also, make it a part of the check-in process, instead of a separate email and give discounts for preordering, frequent fliers, etc."
4055,Beer options were only Michelob Please carry more options or craft beer.
4056,we were told the flight had very limited selection and when it got to row 42 there was not much left. Had I known I would have purchased food in the airport.
4057,"I am so happy to see there is vegetarian option. However, please have Buddhist vegetarian being served instead of vegetarian because Buddhist vegetarian can not consume garlic, onion or scallion but vegetarian can consume any vegetables."
4058,I predators have small sandwiches instead of snacks.
4059,"no,."
4060,Nuts.
4061,Not at this time.
4062,The white wine was undrinkable I had to go to bathroom and dispose of it.
4063,I think we need a better variety of snack choices.
4064,No snacks served.
4065,Need better coffee.
4066,We did get a bag of pretzels.
4067,There could have been more than one white wine offered.
4068,The flight is too short for service.
4069,The water should be a spring water. Dasani is nasty.
4070,Plenty of food. They gave us plenty of beverage and food.
4071,Food was served hot and it was very good.
4072,not really a choice. Would like to know before the flight what ist served.
4073,In an era where the only choice some of the international carriers give pax in economy is where they want to eat or not. I flew Condor to Frankfurt. they only had one entree for everyone. Just awful. Thank you for not following suit.
4074,quality of the food could be better….
4075,No.
4076,no food or beverage served.
4077,Small portions.
4078,I was pleasantly surprised by the beverage and snack service!.
4079,Bring more varieties and more foods.
4080,Give 2 bags of pretzels!!.
4081,I am gluten free and white claws are not good. A gluten free vodka such as Tito's would be excellent!.
4082,Nothing.
4083,We were satisfied with what was served on such a short flight.
4084,I wish United offered a free small snack like Delta and American do.
4085,For someone who is gluten free - I was not able to select any of the free snacks.
4086,No.
4087,It was a morning flight were served pretzels but would have preferred cookies which they had but I was not offered a choice.
4088,The coffee is really not good.
4089,"In first class I believe that craft liquors and beers should be served, not run of the mill bottom shelf items."
4090,Need warm food instead of a box on the EMB-175.
4091,"No longer serving snacks, that is disappointing."
4092,Need proper food for length of flight.
4093,Easier ordering in the app.
4094,It would be nice if there were options that were gluten free. - Like nuts.
4095,No snacks on a 3+ hour flight that began at 5:35 PM. Really!!!!.
4096,There were no options delivered for short flight.
4097,"All good, short flight."
4098,"We paid $10 for a cheese plate that just had cheese, crackers, and a few grapes. No fig jam or chocolate as advertised."
4099,No food only snacks that were not appealing to me.
4100,"In case it [case] is not asked about further in the survey, I want to make sure to send kudos out to Donna and Terrance for how efficient they were in getting the drinks and food out to the first-class cabin. They were a great team and were friendly and accommodating."
4101,"If you are on one destination with two or three legs, do not serve the same hot meals twice on the same trip. Have some extra variety on board even if it is a sandwich or snake meal."
4102,pleasantly surprised when they served the complimentary meal.
4103,The curry chicken lunch was better than I expected and actually had some flavor. Nobody flies steerage expecting a four star meal. I thought what I had was pretty good.
4104,Not really.
4105,No.
4106,"the food is definitely not up to scratch for an 8500$ ticket. i was in the airfrance lounge in paris awaiting a flight to santorini (star alliance does not serve santorini), and the food was 100 times better than anything ever served at polaris or on the plane. even airfrance economy is better than united business."
4107,The food was very good.
4108,Tell the steward and stewardess to quit pre-mixing the drinks before they bring them to you. Revert back to the old days of just providing the mixer and the little bottle.
4109,Very on time.
4110,Having a burger as a breakfast option was rather odd.
4111,"no snacks offered, only food for purcahse."
4112,na.
4113,.
4114,"Would have liked to see snack service after the main meal. Flight was over 5 hours, no snacks offered after the main meal. FC Ticket was EXPENSIVE, so expect more."
4115,"typically I have been offered a pre-flight beverage before take-off. I was on the airplane early, and clearly some passengers received the offer, but it seemed random. also, I have typically had a bottle of water at my seat on boarding, but not on this trip."
4116,I would have liked a variety of diet drinks not just Diet Coke.
4117,A bag of peanuts or snack mix would have been nice!!.
4118,We were delayed 20 minutes waiting for catering to be delivered. Are you short staffed?. Otherwise how does that happen?.
4119,Ran out of most selections by the time they got to us.
4120,"Breakfast options are way too limited and too over the top. Need to provide business class with some less gourmet breakfast options especially when waking up. What happened to the bread service when the flight attendants use to come through and ask if you wanted a danish, etc."
4121,It could have been made clear in a pre flight e mail that food and beverages were not complementary on this flight ( this was a 5 hour flight and the 3rd of our UA flights on our trip) we only heard once we had boarded the aeroplane and we were not the only travellers to be surprised. We then could not download the app and fortunately our very kind flight attendant helped us out.
4122,The meal was very bland. Preordering was not available.
4123,No snack?.
4124,We should have more options.
4125,I wish you would offer a diet and caffeine free soda offering.
4126,Pedestrian.
4127,"You could strip paint with the white wine, horrible."
4128,"The flight from London to Newark had excellent service, from the crew to the food. However, the flight from Newark to London was disgraceful. We were served frozen Turkey sandwiches and very minimal beverage service. Now this is an international flight, the least you can do is serve a hot meal especially being that the flight was so late in the evening. A Lot of people had been at the airport several hours before the flight. This is so sad, I was traveling with my 2 girls and all we got was a cold turkey sandwich which was the size of a childs meal?. this is unacceptable."
4129,Good variety of food and drinks were offered on board. My only comment is that there could be better vegetarian options. Like with the French toast I received a sausage that was unnecessary. Maybe a little more snacks would be nice. Other than that great experience.
4130,"I was surprised that there were no snacks offered along with the drinks, at least none that did not require them to be purchased. Other airlines that I have recently flown, with similar flight times still continue to offer a variety of free snacks."
4131,No food was given out on the flight.
4132,As a frequent traveler I wish the menu varied more often. Always the same options every time. Also the manicotti is too sweet.
4133,"I know that it is difficult to stock different dishes for 28 1st class passengers, ergo, pre-ordering might make things easier for you and your passengers. If you can select your seat, why not select your meals from a number of options."
4134,I flew first/business class paying without points so was quite expensive. Only six Or eight seats and since I was in third row they ran out of options. I had waffle which was good but pure sugar…lactose intolerant so was unable to just eat yoghurt. Early flight and I was hungry!. For the price of seat I would have liked to have options.
4135,The breakfast was very good. I skipped dinner because I was full. In flight snacks were soggy and just came in little bags. This works for coach. I was expecting a bit better presentation and less soggy food in business class.
4136,I wish you had almond or Oak milk to add to the coffee.
4137,A snack bag would be great.
4138,No.
4139,I would like to see the meal selection rotate on a more frequent basis however traveling as much as I do I do understand.
4140,Need more options than pritzel or biscuit.
4141,Nice veggie meal.
4142,Hoping for food in first class but short flight I guess.
4143,No.
4144,"The food options could use more veriety instead of just the biscoff, need nuts or other savory and healthier options. Make it happen."
4145,Food selections are a bit too complex. Simple sandwich or scramble preferred.
4146,All good.
4147,I just think the quantity was way smaller than it should have been.
4148,Fruit was stale.
4149,No.
4150,Please try harder. The food experience on American carriers is so subpar compared to that of other carriers. At least show that you are trying to appeal to passengers in coach as well not just first class. Please make the food items distinguishable instead of looking like slop.
4151,Bland.
4152,Pls have good warm vegetarian options and tea choices.
4153,Have more chicken Entre's available.
4154,"Vegetarian options assume that people like curry. I do not. In the past, there were nice pasta options but this time there was not. Also, on 4 flights this summer, the salad was something that I did not even recognize and did not taste good. I prefer lettuce salads. Many past meals have been very good, just not this time."
4155,Good.
4156,Offer more diet soda bariety.
4157,Few more vegetarian options would be great for a long flight.
4158,Wish they would have passed out water 3 hours into flight.
4159,Should give bottle water no in little cup.
4160,No.
4161,Food was great. Much better than the initial flight from Houston to Liberia.
4162,No.
4163,"I think you can do better with the food, United. Make it simple, but have it be appetizing at least."
4164,"Our special food order placed through the app was lost on both flights despite repeating the order for the 2nd flight. Since my daughter has celiac disease, that was not ok."
4165,No.
4166,The pretzels taste a bit strange.
4167,red wine was weak.
4168,No.
4169,"For flights with at least 2 hours long, United should try to have a decent refreshment and snacks for passengers. It is difficult specially having kids on board and not to offer a decent meal. A sandwich or some other small snack is worth it."
4170,Food was good but ran out of my first choice.
4171,No.
4172,I have melted bc the AC was not working for full flight and while we were sitting for 2 hours waiting for plane to be fixed.
4173,Smooth flight.
4174,"united should provide a small snack like pretzels, cookie, nuts with the beverage."
4175,"Yes, for the last several flights, the vegetarian option is poor quality. The portion is too large, visually unappealing, and bland. Please bring back the short ribs, better quality wine, and the homemade sundaes."
4176,I understand using only credit card. to be completely contactless is not good for people who do not use technology.
4177,Gluten free options were not available.
4178,No.
4179,We really enjoyed being able to pre-order our meals....
4180,I was in first class and there was only one vegan option but it contained dairy which I do not eat so none of the meals worked for me. The flight attendants did put together a few things for me to eat. I was surprised by the lack of options in 1st class.
4181,No limes for my drink.
4182,"Please note my prior responses covered Paris to Chicago and Chicago to Paris. I flew Polaris from ORD-CDG and Premium Plus from CDG-ORD, which are different experiences. I did feel there was value in the Premium Plus offering, but it was more in the seat comfort and space than the food and beverage, which were slightly differentiated from the Economy offering but not as much as I expected."
4183,Better good and snacks. The rest of the world laughs at our airlines on this topic.
4184,Food on the flight from Chicago to Rome 8/16 was atrocious.
4185,"I ordered the brioche burger. The flavor was good -it was kind of like having a fast food burger, so it was satisfying- but they had over-heated it, so I had to wait quite a few minutes before I could eat it. The cheese had largely melted off, so I had to use the knife to spread it back into the burger patty. The fruit is normally really good, but for this flight it seemed underripe. The pineapple and honeydew were very crunchy. The pie in the sky was delicious."
4186,Just a bit more selection of soda.
4187,No.
4188,"Cons: only one option available at the time, did not taste good, portion size was too small, no dessert. A piece of cake or cookies or something as a dessert would have been nice."
4189,I wish there was more variety in the choices. We traveled on several flights recently. the choices were all the same.
4190,Excellent service.
4191,No.
4192,Chicken was cold and hard to cut. Very bland.
4193,Food was lackluster. Did not feel like it was appropriate for Polaris class.
4194,Waffle was extremely sweet.
4195,Give me vegetarian options. I would buy more!. Evening flight back was bad with nothing but the small cheese box being vegetarian.
4196,We usually fly first or in business. the food is somewhat of a struggle. Some flights can have the same meals but just taste different. It is hit and miss at times. The service is always excellent.
4197,I prefer the Biscoff® cookies!. I would be very disappointed if they were not available. <:)>.
4198,No.
4199,"United stated we would have ""snacks for purchase"" on this flight, so we ate an early lunch and purchased a grab-and-go meal for dinner. Right after we departed, we were served lunch, which was unexpected. We wound up having to throw away the meal we had purchased for dinner, because it was not suitable for consumption after the flight."
4200,better wine selection.
4201,If possible offering protein food snack. Most of us are trying to cut down auger consumption.
4202,"Again, I expect more options and better quality from a 1st class flight. The person next to me chose a snack box over the food options."
4203,“Food” service really is not much of a thing since meals are not served on most domestic flights. We usually bring food if we want to eat on the plane.
4204,They serve the drinks half of the glass and not even give the soda canes to us?.
4205,You had the beer brand I want the first time but not the 2nd time!. I can handle having 2 drinks and your arbitrary limits are unnecessary.
4206,Who wants dinner at 1 a.m. - it would have been nicer to have just a snack served so that the rest of us could sleep.
4207,None.
4208,No drink while boarding but lunch order taken. No notification to preorder a meal. Ordered on board tray minus entree. Dessert on tray. Once lunch served no offers until water about 50 minutes prior to landing. I asked if coffee available and did receive. What happened to warm nuts and drink prior to meal?. Dessert after meal?. Airlines requested no mask requirements and yet still providing a less than service.
4209,No.
4210,I was supersized at the quality of the breakfast I was served in first class.
4211,Why are we asked to pick one snack <😞>.
4212,Should have more than one white wine selection.
4213,Good snacks.
4214,Very good in terms of quantity and quality.
4215,They should offer Bigger portions of snacks.
4216,I did not get my preordered snack on flight to Raleigh.
4217,"main meal was not great. my wife could not eat hers. I had pork which was OK, but did not have enough to go around."
4218,Change your kosher food supplier to Hermolis. much better than your people in Antwerp.
4219,"Not satisfied as this 777 First Class flight ran out of breakfast options. There were only 2 options. Very flavorless and could be greatly improved. There are many other United breakfast options that are better than the ones offered on this flight. If there was a pre-order option for all flights providing meals, running out of meals would have been avoided."
4220,Dessert was the highlight.
4221,Morning breakfast was just a yogurt that is not great for people who can not eat dairy. Snacks would have been nice in between meals. Red wine was ice cold.
4222,It seemed on this flight there was a bit of a delay in getting the food out but other than that it was great <:)>.
4223,The gluten free option is also vegan which seriously limits food options. The muffin for breakfast vaguely resembled a muffin but lacked any real flavor.
4224,I have flown in Premium Economy between Denver and London three times in the past three months. On ALL flights one of the meal options has run out before serving all customers.
4225,especially appreciated getting water with no ice!!. and when a stewardess heard me say I would really like some cranberry juice she went and got some!!. 1.
4226,"The main meal was great, but the breakfast before arrival was pretty poor. It was pure sugar. there were not any options, let a lone healthier options. A fruit option & whole grain would have been appreciated."
4227,No.
4228,The food seemed an odd combination of cold udon noodles as salad and a beef entree.
4229,lack of snack. a little cracker\cookie goes a long way. believe it or not.
4230,Wish there was more choices.
4231,Chicken Piri Piri was outstanding for plane food.
4232,Flying first class the food on the second service the burger was not great...
4233,Would be nice if water came in a bottle. Even if it was a small 10oz bottle.
4234,No - I was sleeping.
4235,The grapes were good. the amount was small. I enjoyed the fig spread.
4236,"I did not finish my red wine, because it was Undrinkable!."
4237,"Again, big thank you to the flight attendant. I was really late to the airport and missed grabbing lunch. She was attentive and proactively asked if I needed something to eat due to the flight time. She offered a lunch box (which I politely declined) but was brought some nuts and chips. Again, a Big Thank you!."
4238,"WHAT I am NOT HAPPY ABOUT IS YOU CAN not PAY FOR XTRA FOOD OR SNAKS WITH CASH, I am A CAS PERSON AND DONOT CARRY MY PHONE ON MY VACATION AND WOULD PREFER TO PAY CASH NOT BY CREDIT CARD."
4239,"Yes, on American, they come back around more often refilling beverages including free wine after the meal. I went back to the station at the back of the plane and was told they were out of the bottles of water, that they passed out after the meal which was great, but they did offer me two of the room temperature small plastic glasses. With several empty seats, I was surprised they ran out of bottles..."
4240,Meals offered good variety. Great fruit. Ran out of my entre choice-- french toast by 7th row.
4241,We had to call for flight attendants to serve us on first class seats!!!!.
4242,In first class and not served while boarding.
4243,Attendant was very nice.
4244,The vegetarian food quality could have been better and the provision of dessert rather than the sorbet.
4245,Did not receive our first beverage until 45 minutes into the flight.
4246,No.
4247,Meal was average quality. Chocolate ice cream was good.
4248,The omelette was simple and delicious and I had some Prosecco that was quite good.
4249,"Flight from Accra. Kofoka had better food quality than flight from Washington, Dulles."
4250,Offer variety.
4251,It is disappointing that first class is not receiving cocktails before take off.
4252,Contactless purchasing was not an option for us. Very inconvenient.
4253,None.
4254,Better food.
4255,"I miss the snacks (pretzel, cookie, chips, banana, nutri grain bar) you would receive 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through the flight (business class)."
4256,I do not like the small coffee cups - even in first class. I would prefer the waffle comes with maple syrup. the fruit atop the waffle is usually soggy.
4257,Gluten free options not provided and should be.
4258,I think there should be a more nutritional snack provided something protein based… at least three choices.. a snack bar… a small cheese and cracker box and a cookie trio small package .. maybe talk to costco on putting together something.. I know of a family owned company out of the chicago area that does a lot of trade shows and could work with you on putting a package together for yoh.
4259,We miss the quality of food from the 80s when United owned their own kitchens!.
4260,"In business class, we used to get menus and several choices. Not so much any more."
4261,I was satisfied and had no complaints.
4262,no.
4263,More non - alcoholic trinks.
4264,Better snack box options.
4265,No.
4266,Dinner was really good. Breakfast was not complete (yogurt+biscotti).
4267,no.
4268,"The Kosher meal was amazing, best meals I have ever received on United airlines. There was variety, good portions, and attractive. The taste was good and it looked and was inviting."
4269,Food was average.
4270,"I am disappointed that spirits are not included in the free drinks and are also very expensive,."
4271,"The snack boxes were not available, and I wish I would have known that in advance so I could have brought my own."
4272,"Ran out of both wine I was drinking and diet coke. Minimal refreshment of drinks, though I did appreciate the pre-departure drink (which was not present on my flight to Paris). Menu indicated there would be snacks. I did not receive any. Meals were really sub-par compared to First/business on American Airlines or Delta, which have much more food, more appetizing, served warm, etc."
4273,I would like them to offer a small bottle of water as you enter the plane. They do have carts in airports that do this. I think it would be a nice thing to do.
4274,Too many items on a small tray. Space is the problem.
4275,It was good.
4276,Snacks provided were high sugar.
4277,Nop.
4278,"Only 2 choices Impossible Meatball (not meat) or a chicken that i never heard of. This paled in comparison to other first class trips especially overseas. It was food, it was eatable, but nothing special - for a first class fare."
4279,"I enjoyed the snacks, that is a plus!."
4280,"For a 5 hour flight, we were offered one drink and one small snack. Additional water was given."
4281,No.
4282,No biscuits nor pretzels.
4283,food options were very limited.
4284,Would be nice if Coffee/ Tea will be proactively offered throughout the flight.
4285,"Bring back better snacks!. Peanuts, pretzels,."
4286,Was not aware we would not be receiving food on board maybe say this when we make reservations or maybe I missed it.
4287,Good to have snacks (cookies) again. My last few NY/Chicago flights did not have them.
4288,Offering of snacks in First Class is very limited when compared to other airlines.
4289,Find the good food supplier and taste first to suit with customers. First served meal taste horrible but send served breakfast is good. Good to upgrade flight entertainment as set up a message chair and allow 15 minutes for individuals. You can charge this service and passengers would not mind paying that. But care for hygiene by laying papers like message shops. Very stiff to ride long hour flight. Give spacing for 2 message chair worthy.
4290,No.
4291,should have offered wine and a small snack like nuts or pretzels.
4292,Very slow.
4293,"while the first meal entree was good, the breakfast entree was poor."
4294,It was airplane food. Alaska airlines does a better job on the food.
4295,I did not receive an email prior to flight for my meal selection!. I had paid for my first class ticket (did not use miles or was it an upgraded seat). Was disappointed. I sit in the last row in first class to lessen exposure to people sneezing behind me. If I had received an email for meal selection I would not have ordered the meal I ate as that was the only thing left!. DISAPPOINTED.
4296,Would like little pretzels or snacks provided with drink.
4297,It is was great to actually receive a meal one could eat. Thank you for moving back to more acceptable food.
4298,No.
4299,"Since we were going to Hawaii it would have been nice to introduce something from the area - pineapple, Hawaiian shortbread cookie etc.. Guava juice."
4300,offered water twice on a five hour flight.
4301,More variety in snacks.
4302,Glad that hot black tea is a choice;. would like to see green and/or herbal teas available.
4303,Ok.
4304,I have been on 3 United Flights in a month. You offer every liquor with the EXCEPTION of TEQUILA!!. Why?.
4305,Hope there will be other choices next time.
4306,na.
4307,"More choices in entres needed, at least one more preferably a total of 4 choices."
4308,Breakfast pancakes were undercooked.
4309,Maybe start to include small complimentary snack in economy class.
4310,It would be nice to have honey available for tea.
4311,There was no sparkling wine selections.
4312,No.
4313,I am a very picky person. I was happy they had something I liked.
4314,"Bring back the dessert cart with proper sundaes, whipped cream and chocolate sauce and nuts."
4315,Why do we get the same Lemon Sorbet/Ice every flight for desert?.
4316,Wine quality.
4317,No.
4318,When you include a salad with the entree you should provide a salad dressing. Who eats a naked salad?.
4319,No beverage or food was served.
4320,"Yes, better quality, quantity instead of many messages on leaving your credit card number to purchase lack luster treats."
4321,More selections.
4322,Small portion of main entree.
4323,None.
4324,"Offer something other than a graham cracker cookie. I would suggest cheese & crackers, the pre-packed kind."
4325,Need more complementary snack options.
4326,Very good.
4327,The quality of the food United offers seems to have declined over the years while other airlines have improved theirs. I just wanted to state that observation.
4328,I do not want to have to download the app in order to buy refreshments.
4329,"No snack (pretzels or anything) was offered. In an hour flight, the time isnthere."
4330,"Having a non-phosphate drink option other than water, such as a diet 7up or diet sprite would be helpful for passengers with kidney issues."
4331,No snack provided!. I do enjoy the small snack and was disappointed one was not offered.
4332,offer more variety.
4333,Please have vegetarian options for passengers. or at least allow them to pre-order.
4334,No.
4335,Menu items not available.
4336,The Icecream were already melting when I received.
4337,I do not recall being asked if I wanted a beverage with my meals.
4338,All was good.
4339,Food was really good!.
4340,food choice changed because of flight change.
4341,There were no snacks distributed.
4342,No free snacks were offered on this flight.
4343,No.
4344,"Sorry clicked wrong button... we DID buy snacks. While we were satisfied, I would recommend a more child-oriented option that has kid friendly snacks. We bought ""recline"" and ""tapas"" and mixed and matched."
4345,The Seagrams seltzer is BAD—salty!. That is not seltzer—it is soda water. Choose a better brand!.
4346,No.
4347,Yes… the terminal was far out of the United airlines area. My luggage was lost once landed to my destination. I got charged for a carry-on luggage.
4348,Only that the desert cookie was from an unhealthy commercial brand usually seen in gas stations.
4349,Difeent kinds of tea.
4350,No.
4351,It was very good. Wish you had similar on domestic flights. Thanks.
4352,"REAL DECAF Coffee would be nice. And serve it [Coffee] hot!. Less salt on entrees. Use real cheese, not process. Ditto for turkey or keep it off the sandwich."
4353,"Dinner was not hot, barely warm. Would be nice to have a change from the Barley salad."
4354,No.
4355,"The overall quality of food served in business class has gone down over the last few years, especially on international flights."
4356,On long haul flights offer snacks more frequently.
4357,.
4358,do not like the credit card being required on app for purchases.
4359,I was surprise that there were no spirits offered on this flight.
4360,It was served with a smile!.
4361,Ran out of the waffle snack my favorite.
4362,Having foods with herbs and spices does not set well while flying.
4363,It would be nice to offer some low sugar beverages.
4364,Please keep the Asian vegetarian option. The usual vegetarian option (pasta/cheese) is not healthy for me. Thank you.
4365,"The fish course seemed a little small, but i was happy with that as I wanted something light after eating in the lounge. When I flew before the pandemic the food service was not much better. A starter being a supreme separate course, and the famous dessert trolley with the much better quality ice cream sundae with various toppings to choose made right in front of you. For the price and expectations a passenger has in the top class of travel with you, these should be brought back...along with hot towels to freshen up. Other airlines manage this in First and Business - so why can not United...especially as they used too?!."
4366,"Very disappointed that we had to pay for certain drinks, whereas on other trans Atlantic flights these are included."
4367,Breakfast was awful ...very dry pancakes or rubbery eggs.
4368,Food could be a little better tasting.
4369,Food was so much better than that served on the Denver- Frankfurt flight in which I was a Polaris Business customer!.
4370,"Serve lettuce, tomato, pickles with the cheeseburger."
4371,None.
4372,Red wine was cold.
4373,No snack was offered.
4374,They were stale. Hard to chew.
4375,Perfect.
4376,The breakfast waffles were hot but far too sweet. The bread roll was stiff.
4377,No.
4378,Would rather have Woodford Reserve available as a bourbon vs buffalo chip trace.
4379,An extra round of water would be fine.
4380,Would have liked some fresh sandwiches.
4381,Disappointed that I did not receive my burger.
4382,None.
4383,The Thai chicken and rice was not great. Chicken was grounded/minced. But I was pleasantly surprised that this was part of the premium seating.
4384,Should have served twice. Only served once after take off.
4385,Finally back to hot food!. Thank you!. Way ahead of Delta!.
4386,Asked for decaf and coffee was great and piping hot!.
4387,No.
4388,No.
4389,Keep up the good work.
4390,Change to a diferent kind of food.
4391,Wish they offered alcohol to buy.
4392,It was definitely not up to par with what I used to receive in business class on trans-atlantic flights in recent previous years.
4393,Solid meal.
4394,If you serve just sandwiches and at least charge including with the tickets would be great.
4395,Free snacks would be great.
4396,Good coffee.
4397,Longer flight need more food.
4398,No.
4399,they ran out of dinner options when they arrived where I was seated.
4400,Improve your food quality for First. Other airlines are much better.
4401,It was really good.
4402,Wished there were different options.
4403,Very nice breakfast. It was unexpected.
4404,I flew Swiss during the summer in a short flight. they had a nice and fresh selection of things.
4405,we use to get an actual meal for this portion of the trip.
4406,"Not for this flight, but as I said earlier the food on the flight from Chicago to Honolulu was not very good."
4407,None.
4408,Not much options for diet soda.
4409,Our lunch entry was very good. It was chicken in a creamy mushroom sauce. The meal also had scalloped potatoes and green beans. For our last snack we had a warm pretzel bun filled with turkey and cheese.
4410,Not enough short ribs to supply demand. Allow pre-order for this flight.
4411,More wine and beer choices available.
4412,Was not given choices.
4413,None.
4414,Pretzels were hard and old!.
4415,The meals I was served were delicious!. I was happily surprised.
4416,N/a.
4417,The lunch menu needs to changed The chicken azar. meatless meat balls are not good choices. The chicken is terrible need a better preparation Add a $1 to the meal to get something better.
4418,No.
4419,Meals should be served on long flights if it is meal time.
4420,"ice cream was frozen rock solid , ran out of water bottles."
4421,no.
4422,I liked that there were sparkling water options.
4423,The meal choices were excellent.
4424,The short rib is a perpetual winner in my book. And the wine variety was pretty impressive - 3 reds and 3 whites.
4425,The limitations of the drink.
4426,more snack offerings.
4427,"Preordering seems to be basically worthless. Maybe it helps United predict interest and affects the number to be stocked for each item, but from my standpoint, I do not see any benefit. First of all, half the items (including all the meal / non-snack items) were marked as ""out of stock"" when I preordered. It seems the system only really knows how to preorder the snacks that are always available. Second, with the confusion over my seat assignment, the preorder seemed to have been lost anyways."
4428,First class is not what it [class] used to be. on this flight the flight attendant made us feel first class!.
4429,"For first class they should have provided some sort of small snack or meal. While a short flight, something should be offered."
4430,food was cold and tasteless.
4431,It would be nice to get back to the little packs of pretzles again. If we are not masking any more it seems we could.
4432,Need more variety of juice and soda.
4433,I thought the food choices could be more numerous and improve.
4434,No.
4435,Food was horrible. The lady next to me could not even eat it [Food]. The great flight attendant did her best to accommodate her. their were no options.
4436,You need to offer up to two snacks or make Portion sizes bigger. It is a taste not a snack. Offer customers 2 snacks not just 1.
4437,The portion is perfect for the duration of the flight.
4438,Very quick checked bag. Waited less than 5 minutes Great job!!!!.
4439,Non.
4440,Michelob ultra was the only available beer and it is not very good.
4441,No.
4442,Only water was offered as it was a quick one hour flight. That was just fine.
4443,Thank you for having a vegan option.
4444,There was no food or beverages offered in flight...... plus too much plane machine noise for whole time!!.
4445,"There were only one choice of food, on this flight.(. Indian , Vegan food extremely spicy!). My children could not have dinner!!!. At least I was expecting any kind of option."
4446,"Some kid friendly drinks would be great- ones with straws or covered lids so they can not spill. Milk boxes with straws, etc."
4447,There was not any.
4448,"Not a long flight but did not have snacks, seemed odd."
4449,"Beverages were great. No snacks were provided. Delta always provides snacks. As travelers, we look forward to the small things like snacks. They do not cost very much to provide but make the flying experience better. Give snacks."
4450,I greatly appreciate receiving a whole can and not just a cup of soda.
4451,I plan to do this again on our return flight.
4452,Love the biscoff & coffee.
4453,Convenient pre- flight credit card entry.
4454,No snacks/food were offered for the flight in the first class cabin.
4455,Even though they ran out of chicken. the pasta was good. Dessert was included in the meal package.
4456,"Wish there were some low carb options. Fruits, veggies, nuts, and proteins are good."
4457,The flight attendant forgot to pass the cookies /stroops out. got us one when we asked. Also I would have loved a second cup of coffee. there was not an opportunity to ask anyone.
4458,"This is unrelated to my flight, and probably an insane, ineffective request. I really do hope the Polaris Sundae™ returns."
4459,Wpuld like bloody Mary juice back as soon as possible.
4460,Need more snack options please and on long hauls it would be nice to get a second round later in the flight.
4461,More organic stuff anf alternatives like kombucha or green tea.
4462,Having better options avail to purchase preflight.
4463,"Please bring back the dessert cart - with the sundae and other desserts. Also, on the meal tray, please bring back either a cheese/meat small plate/app along with salad. Currently the roll, salad and entree make the tray look empty and appears to be lower value for a business class dinner/lunch meal. Thank you."
4464,"By the time they got to us, it was a matter of taking what was left."
4465,No.
4466,Would be nice to have a little more substantial snack than pretzels or cookies (small bags).
4467,Please read my first comment.
4468,I did not get anything from this light.
4469,was not sure how to pay with the app.
4470,Keep them Diet Cokes coming!.
4471,The loading the credit card into the united app makes no sense if I have apple wallet. I should be able to use either.
4472,Good food. Nice sandwich.
4473,Good quality and very tasty.
4474,Please bring back peanuts or almonds or cashews.
4475,The snack sandwich was still frozen still when served.
4476,On way over got free food and beverage due to 21/2 hour delay. Very difficult problems by delay but thought it was nice for United to do some little thing for passengers. Unusual and appreciated this was dc to no flight.
4477,The butter was too cold to spread on my bread so I had to sit on it to warm it up.
4478,This time jet had Ginger ale.
4479,the second snack was greasy to handle and not very tasty.
4480,It would be nice to offer a snack. In the past I was always offered pretzels or other small snack but the last two flights I have taken have not had that option.
4481,Not applicable.
4482,"Could not add payment to my account, so was not able to get additional snacks and drinks."
4483,No.
4484,"No received aniting food, only soda drink."
4485,"While the meals you now serve in First Class would have been typical mediocre meals served in Economy Class thirty years ago, they are FAR SUPERIOR to many of the ""meals"" you have been serving in First Class in recent years. Thank you for making improvements . . . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!."
4486,"It would really be nice if the wines / sparkling wines (not real champagne, but sparkling wine) were a bit nicer. They were pretty low-end / overly sweet. The burger was fun!. I never get a burger on a plane and I totally enjoyed it. YOU SHOULD HAVE THE WARM NUTS FOR APPETIZER, AND THE WARM COOKIES AT THE END OF THE FLIGHT!!. those are the two best parts and they do have to be warm!."
4487,Did not consume any.
4488,Great kosher food out of Brussels.
4489,no.
4490,No.
4491,You need to offer more than a choice of one snack on a flight that completely covers dinner time. A small sandwich would have been so appreciated. not even offering multiple snacks was very disappointing.
4492,"Would be helpful to have written info about drink, food & entertainment options."
4493,Great selection to choice from.
4494,Good taste;. Tea was very hot-PERFECT.
4495,No.
4496,Very satisfied with the cheese & snack kit provided.
4497,No.
4498,"Nice to pre order food, still can not understand the other vegetarian offerings that smell terribly, and not the greatest tasting."
4499,Please do not serve Chobani to a flight headed to Athens. Please if you are going to serve “Greek yogurt” serve actually Greek yogurt. Fage is great. Nancy's yogurt is not Greek but it is good yogurt. Chobani a) uses gums and fillers and b) a Turkish company and you should not use it on a flight to Greece. If you do not know the reason … Google Erdogan latest statements on Greece to find out why we do not want to support Turkish origin companies.
4500,Falling behind other international business class competitors.
4501,"i have a lot of dietary restrictions and would have liked plain, unseasoned nuts of some sort. could not eat any of the other snacks. it was not a big deal, but I am probably not the only one.."
4502,"I could not understand the flt attendant on the ""cookie"" so I chose pretzels. They were tiny ... with a tiny amount... why bother?."
4503,For the price between coach and FC United should invest more to the quality and choices on preordered food.
4504,Great team.
4505,Excellent!!...
4506,no.
4507,I preordered food which was not available on the flight. The food I received was good. just not what I ordered.
4508,Please continue to offer complimentary snacks and beverages.
4509,Please offer better tasting wine.
4510,There is No warm food available on this flight.
4511,No.
4512,Great to have full meal service in first class but the options were not delicious.
4513,Coffee on united tastes real bad.
4514,"None served on short, quick flight."
4515,I would expect a larger variety on a 5 hour flight.
4516,The red wine was awful.
4517,Dinner was quite good. Breakfast was inedible. Egg was a rubber ball. Pancakes werr terrible.
4518,Get rid of Stella it is getting boring Also change beers more often octoberfest etc.
4519,1st class meal needs to be better prepared by the United contractor. Definitely has gone down hill in quality.
4520,I was satisfied with the food and beverages provided.
4521,Not pleased with the 2 choices.
4522,No food served;. only soda.
4523,Maybe offer a better snack. Like a mini popcorn or cookie.
4524,It is fine . I just happened to fall asleep the the whole . But the selection you have is great .
4525,From in flight meal to breakfast before landing I would have like more frequent offerings of water during the flight. Thank you!.
4526,no.
4527,A snack a bit bigger would be nice !.
4528,"Only colas offered in diet pop. I did make an iced coffee, worked great!."
4529,Cherry coke would be awesome!!.
4530,No.
4531,"Servings in the back are always small. It is coach, I get it."
4532,Need a gluten free option!!!!!.
4533,In total 4 flights with meals and three of the four all had the same options to choose from. Would have liked a bit more variety.
4534,"They only came once, very rushed and never came back."
4535,No.
4536,"We were on several flight. east and west, and the entrees were all the same and not appealing to us."
4537,Shoul ne always unopened!. Like cans or water's bottles.
4538,"Beer taste was not good, on one leg of the flight. no snacks were offered."
4539,I loved that I could save my cc in advance.
4540,Need titos.
4541,could have been a wider choice.
4542,"The breakfast was served pretty late on a flight that would last only two hours in the air. I wanted to sleep. the food came about halfway into the flight. Earlier would have been helpful. But it was good )). Most importantly: the cabin temperature was extremely cold back in my row. The front of first class was not as cold. we were freezing. And the crew never made any adjustments (or whatever they may have tried) did not work. I had to wear a light jacket (all I had) and use a blanket, and I was still freezing. And I had a warm shirt on to begin with due to the chilly early morning weather. This made for a negative overall flight experience, despite everything else being really good. Disappointing for first class especially."
4543,I did not purchase anything. Also did not like that one could not purchase food or drinks unless you had pre-arranged credit card on Ap.
4544,Snack service needs more variety. A bagged sandwich (no choice) thrown at you with no accompaniment is pretty unappealling on an international flight.
4545,We should have received some kind of snack between the lunch and skimpy pretzel roll we got before landing.
4546,Breakfast was just a yogurt. After so many flight hours I would have preferred something more.
4547,Nil.
4548,"Disappointed that cookies/pretzels were not provided. With the price of the ticket, I do not think that would be unreasonable."
4549,Why beverage service no longer available?.
4550,Better cookies plesse.
4551,It was nice to get a choice for the snack.
4552,Those tiny little snacks when you pay all that money for an airline ticket is very disappointing.
4553,"Do not force us to buy through your app and having to join Mileage Plus. Way more time than just giving flight attendant a credit card. I am old and technologically challenged. Flight attendant helped me on flight out. On flight back, attendant could not. So I got the wine and food for free. even though I wanted to pay. I will never use the Mileage Plus card as a result. Do not hesitate to call me, Ron Yank, at 415.860-9547. Customer of UA for over 40 years, always using your airline, except on the one occasion my wife and I flew with Lufthansa to the Middle East."
4554,Fresh fruit would be a nice alternative for a snack vs sugary snacks.
4555,No.
4556,I wish United served Brandy.
4557,The white wine served on flight to Chicago and back was disgusting.
4558,no.
4559,Is it possible for you to offer a snack that is both gluten/dairy and peanut free?.
4560,No.
4561,"While I was sent an email to preorder my meals for my outbound flights, I did not receive such an email for the inbound/return flights. When I logged in to do so, I was only able to preorder on one leg of the trip, as most items were ""sold out"" on the SNA-IAH leg. Would like to receive an email to do so for both departing and returning flights."
4562,Sorry - nothing offered on that very short flight.
4563,I was in economy flight...did not expect more.. thank you very much..
4564,You should have the option to buy food and drinks with credit card.
4565,Would like a broader beer selection.
4566,Ice cream as the only dessert is a problem for those with lactose intolerance.
4567,More variety.
4568,"The waffle was soggy, and the fruit whatever it was , was more on the slimy side."
4569,I slept on this leg.
4570,I have flown several times from the east coast where no food was offered?.
4571,less spicy food would be preferable.
4572,A small quality snack was very appreciated.
4573,"I tried for 4 days to make a food selection online. The entire time I was only given one option: A mediterranean dish I knew would be too spicy for me and I would be unable to eat it. I once saw a meatball option but it was unselectable. Why does United insist on serving such spicy food?. I took one bite and then had to drink a glass of water and not able to eat the entree. Why was I unable to see and select the second entree when trying to order 4 days ahead of flight?. Flight attendant said both options should have been available the entire time to order. In addition, my choice issue was due to United changing my flight several months ahead an not only not notifying me, but assigning me a seat in the last row when I had booked 2B 6 months earlier."
4574,"There was a very small amount of turbulence so no food. beverage was provided. On the return trip from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I was given a half a glass of room temperature water, no ice, no snack."
4575,No.
4576,"Not back to the hot meals of yesterday, but it is getting better. I like the utensils and cloth napkins again."
4577,Ignored my requests for drink.
4578,"As,earlier, limited ice, not all meals,were provided to plane.... no snax."
4579,Our breakfast eggs were not warm.
4580,"I was surprised that it took so long to receive beverages. A flight attendant passed out pretzels pretty quickly, but then the drinks came nearly a half hour later as they started with the cart in the front of the plane and very slowly worked back."
4581,Wish a better selection of sodas such as offering Dr. Pepper Zero or diet Dr. Pepper. when flying out of Huntsville last year. Diet Dr. Peppers were offered.
4582,I did not have any food or beverages on this flight.
4583,Crowded seating.
4584,no wine or champagne offered at all.
4585,White wine was awful.
4586,It is been a long time since United had my GF meal on the flight. The food was pretty good. I was happy to not be starving!. Thanks for bringing back specialty meals.
4587,"We had a chicken meal on our flight to Europe, that was horrible-,this one was MUCH better."
4588,On the way out they had the usual United sundaes which are a major benefit of traveling United. On the way back I asked for the ice cream and got a teeny tiny little tub of ice cream. It was nice but about a fifth the size of a sundae.
4589,The free wine is a nice idea. the wine was bad.
4590,Imentioned in the past the meals need improvement but could not point myfingers on something special. Allow me to offer you to take a look at Turkish Airlines menue. It appears (to me) to be an example to be taken from.
4591,Maybe some healthier options for those of us who do not drink soda.
4592,Same menu for months on end.
4593,No.
4594,No.
4595,The water is good.
4596,We flew first class. The food offering was very limiting. The chicken was dried out.
4597,no snack served and had to ask for the whole can. On my previous flight it was automatically given.
4598,"It is a short flight no snacks were offered. From Portland to Denver no snacks offered, in the past there has been a snack offered."
4599,My flight down to DC had none and that seemed to becoming a norm for this flight. This flight attendant did an excellent job as he brought the snack choice thru and then water. Much appreciated!.
4600,We are accustomed to the lack of food on flights.
4601,There is not much choice for snacks. often out of food for people who have a short lay-over. Only one diet drink.
4602,The waffle cookies tasted great.
4603,The portions are too small.
4604,No complimentary snacks were provided.
4605,No food snacks were provided.
4606,I was surprised and pleased to be able to use United Miles to pay for the glass of wine. It is extremely difficult to use miles for travel. And the amount required continues to go up. Buying food is great. I did not know about that until this flight.
4607,"I had trouble adding my credit card into into the app, so could not purchase snacks on board. Also, would be nice to have a snack option with some protein, like almonds."
4608,no.
4609,No Tito's vodka and took a long time to get it as soda water was not available in front of plane.
4610,No.
4611,"Snacks offered are definitely not of adequate variety, quality, or quantity for one hour, thirty minute flight. Did not expect a meal, but a small bag of pretzels or waffle is inadequate."
4612,Overall good.
4613,I think the preorder idea is good.
4614,Meal before deplaning was nice and the right size.
4615,"Cheese plate offered only three small pieces of cheddar, all tasteless and came in a most unattractive and difficult to open plastic package. The breakfast would have been better without it. Except that Corn Flakes taste like styrofoam."
4616,no.
4617,Snacks could be more varied. Cookies and pretzels. Gluten free options would be nice too.
4618,Wish we still had a small bag of pretzels or something to go with the drink.
4619,No.
4620,"Again, there is a lack of gluten free snack/food options."
4621,No.
4622,It would have been nice to have a savory choice instead of two types of sweets.
4623,No choice as to snack. And the snacks are way too small.
4624,I was given a small glass of soft drink with an abundance of ice leaving little room for beverage. I was nor offered the entire can of soda.
4625,I asked for the snack with my coffee and a flight attendant made an extra effort to go get it.
4626,Got nothing but pretzel and coke nothing else was offered.
4627,Dinner in first class should be better.
4628,no.
4629,Fake meatballs and an indian dish can not be what your business customers are asking for!.
4630,Its getting better.
4631,The entree was not good at all. Snacks were OK. The pretzels tasted a bit old.
4632,Quality not up to before that of pandemic.
4633,I asked to have a brandy after dinner drink the person was not a real stewardess I think she was training no idea she came back k and very rudely said no brandy and kept walking. I would have paid for one ad I really enjoyed my meal and wanted to finish it eith a brandy. Also no duty free came around.
4634,My meal and wine service was fantastic. My spouse had the chicken rice dish which was very dry.
4635,"I would leave off the salt & pepper, add 2 cherry tomatoes and slice the cheese to fit on the crackers. The fig spread was nice."
4636,no.
4637,No.
4638,Food needs to be upgraded.
4639,I did not order any other food. Short flight.
4640,Mimosa's were fantastic.
4641,No.
4642,"If you say you want a drink, you get a drink, but no one asks if you also want a snack;. they are gone and that is it. No big deal, but the attendants should ask both questions."
4643,"Yes, when I flew from Chicago to Tulsa I asked the flight attendant for a bag of pretzels, she told me that the flight was to short and that there were no snacks on the flight. You have to remember we had just spent 2 hours waiting for the crew..."
4644,"There was a small confusion re my special meal order, but the flight attendants fix this in a great way. I am glad there was a vegetarian option available!."
4645,they did not have the glenfargas whiskey that is standard on all UA flights;. also the wine selection is poor.
4646,They ran out of diet coke.
4647,It could be better.
4648,Varieyty of snacks.
4649,No.
4650,Ease of use when credit card tied to app. And flight attendant very pleasant and acommodating.
4651,I miss the nuts or pretzels.
4652,YOU COULD GIVE MORE THAN ONE TINY BAG OF PRETZELS.
4653,wine selection needs to be increased.
4654,"I pre-ordered a snack n I had to request it from the flight attendants. In Alaska airlines, I pre-order n the flight attendants delivers it to me once we are in the air. Some of the liquor I wanted to pre-order were not available."
4655,Loved everything but the dessert.
4656,I would love to but though the app….
4657,I recognize that Hurricane Ian prevented any meals or snack boxes from being served on this long flight. The communications that the airline provided PRIOR to this flight to suggest people get food at the airport was thoughtful and well received.
4658,I wish the dinner/lunch options were as good/tasty as the breakfast!. I can not stand the impossible meatballs/chicken dish.
4659,There were a few passengers with tight connections. The delay in the gate operator caused anxieties amongst the passengers. The flight attendants could have requested other passengers to allow those catching another flight to ng o first. I feel the attendants were indifferent. I was extremely disappointed.
4660,The desert was Sorbet. It was served to us at the same time as the meal. So it was all melted once I got to eat it. There was no desert options. One of the main dish was chicken on quinoa. every time I have quinoa on a plane (regardless of the company) it is alway super dry.
4661,I suspect the same meal options were served in all classes. I expected to have more options. Need to be able to pre order meals.
4662,Wine service was outstanding!!.
4663,really not good what the airlines give to the passengers but this is the reality.
4664,i do not have a smart phone so i can not down load an app to purchase any products.
4665,Do not think I should pay for a meal on a 5 hour flight that was also an expensive flight.
4666,Please serveva breakfast sandwich.
4667,No.
4668,Perhaps a healthy cho.
4669,"The variety of wines seemed ok, but I had to ask to be served several times to get a glass of wine."
4670,"It seems to be a theme on these overnight flights that after the first service, the flight attendants disappear from Economy for hours. While I do not think it is necessary to push a cart around, these long flights need more water or liquids for the pax. At the very least, each hour a flight attendant could walk through the cabin and provide an opportunity for pax requests."
4671,The dinner portion was too small 4-5 small pieces of chicken is hardly called as a dinner meal for 2067$ flight. I carried my own meal and carried plenty of snacks for the crew who loved my snacks. Most people I know fly Emirates and such airline as the meals on board are actually appetizing. United could consider to make the meal more appetizing a tiny salad and small meal does not attract the passengers. It is taking passengers away from UNITED. They fly as there is no choice. Make UNITED an airline of choice not otherwise.
4672,Chicken was spicy only other selection was a plant based meatball. Maybe something plainer like a burger.
4673,No.
4674,No.
4675,Brioche Burger was ok for airline food. I was so hungry I would have eaten anything. I was just so happy they had the option.
4676,I loved the desert question…I forgot how good it was!!!!.
4677,None provided only San Fransico to Newark.
4678,I wish there were healthier options with less sugar.
4679,N/A no service.
4680,The snacks what about 2 of the items.
4681,"On both flights we took to and from California, the non- chicken entree was meat-less meatballs. Not a food I would ever be interested in eating. Also, on the flight to California I selected one of the boxes instead of the meat-less meatballs and was disappointed that the second cheese had been replaced with fig spread."
4682,I would like chocolate cooy.
4683,Wine selection.
4684,"The breakfast menu did not exist, the fruit that was provided for breakfast was still green for a banana. The red wine I had for dinner was not very good."
4685,"I was served milk which I asked for when I found out that they do not serve hot chocolate. Southwest Airlines serves hot chocolate. It would add to your choice of beverages to add hot chocolate to the menu,."
4686,How bout some healthier snacks!!.
4687,Enjoyed Tomato Juice.
4688,More teas.
4689,No.
4690,No only the amount of snack.
4691,it was a quick flight so there was no food or beverage.
4692,No.
4693,All of these responses are only because we were first class!.
4694,I still miss the ice cream dessert cart.
4695,Healthy and tasty. Adding quinoa to the mix was a hit.
4696,Non alcoholic beer.
4697,"Crew were helpful, boeing 787 model makes long haul pleasant."
4698,"ask for a coke and was giving a sugar free soda, did not like this."
4699,The food was not tasty. Options limited.
4700,water was warm. snack was small. we pay way to much money for warm water.
4701,Better snacks.
4702,"No free snack was given, no ice tea or juice option."
4703,The coffee is instant coffee but surprisingly tasty.
4704,It is good fly experience.
4705,no.
4706,Back then we got served twice with an meal it got changed I guess if you can confirm.
4707,"Waters served in a cup. Although we are passed Covid Peak times we have lost the option to have a small bottle of water. I really appreciated having the small bottles of water because they have caps to close off the bottle and I can conveniently place it inside my seat back pocket if I chose to fall asleep, or if we experience turbulence."
4708,"Offer a gluten free, protein option."
4709,The soft drink was served with three ice cubes.
4710,Food quality can improve. the chicken was hard to bite.
4711,Both the Takeoff package and the Asiago Bagel were good. The asiago bagel was cooked just right and was delicious.
4712,Portions should be larger. the bread is always so cold.
4713,you ran out of things and it was the first hour of the trip.
4714,Need slightly larger portions.
4715,Food options between meals was sparse. Expect real food options when meals are 12+ hours apart. Plus they ran out of ice hours before arriving in Singapore.
4716,Would have liked to have healthier choices.
4717,No.
4718,"We did not get the option to choose our snack. On the flight we were given the whole drink can but on another, we only got some poured into a cup. The whole can was best."
4719,5 hour flight. Need better food.
4720,No pretzels. They loaded the wrong cart.
4721,"flight attendants either unaware. ignored preorder, had to request order after snack service completed."
4722,Gummie bears was a nice surprise.
4723,"Yes,I like."
4724,The vegetarian chili was not very good.
4725,"I felt that the meal service came way too late in this flight. This was a 7hr overnight flight, and the meal service came about 2hrs into the flight, which meant I was not able to even attempt to sleep until after then. The quality of the meal (chicken with queso and quinoa) was also not great."
4726,No wine list to chose from.
4727,Maybe have more of a selection of snacks.
4728,I would have preferred Coke Zero but was told they had run out. we were only on row 14. We flew to Seattle on a different airline that was somewhat cheaper and they did two beverages and snack runs while y’all did one and then came around and offered water!.
4729,very hard to get app and way to confusing. easier when you could just use your credit card.
4730,"Can pretzels be replaced with some other better tasting item?. Also, can use couple more items to choose from. Thanks."
4731,"I love being able to preorder my meal!!!. On this flight though, the flight attendant said my order did not come through even though we had confirmation it was placed. Luckily she was still able to give me what I wanted."
4732,Complimentary pretzels were stale.
4733,Too expensive.
4734,No.
4735,Wish you had more real food options.
4736,Going contactless for onboard purchases sounds like a great idea but significantly affects elderly patients that are not Tech savvy.
4737,Nope!.
4738,No comments.
4739,Appreciated that the flight attended remembered the preordered snack.
4740,more healthy optiond.
4741,"To be clear on the food presentation and service, the flight attendants were great. But I would really like to see United bring back the ""courses"" of serving. Starting with warm nuts and a drink. Then the salad and appetizer. Then the main course. And - and I am sure you have heard this - please bring back the Sundae trolley. Not only was it tasty, it is one of those things that sets United apart from others and makes the experience nicer. To me the meal, especially on a long flight, helps makes the flight go faster and is part of the ""niceness"" of sitting in Polaris."
4742,Tea & coffee provided was as cold as it could worst be.....
4743,I wish there were more food choices to purchase on board.
4744,I had coffee sugar and cream and it just tasted really cheap and shitty. I would have assumed first class would have been a lot better.
4745,Should occasional offer water/tea between 2 meals . it was long flight.
4746,"Food quality was very average and many options are “out of stock” by the time it reached me. I paid for business class and for both meal options I had no “option” but to receive the only meal choice that they had less. Meal quality was just average, pretty disappointing."
4747,"No...just thanked the flight crew and captains for a GREAT flight,."
4748,"While the quality of the food on the SFO to Zurich flight was quite good, the food on the Zurich to SFO was really not very good."
4749,Should provide more than 1 snack.
4750,The white wine was very poor. other drinks were fine.
4751,The burger was terrible.
4752,Thanks to United for serving regular food again!. I was very tired of the wrapped sandwiches and snack boxes during COVID.
4753,Please bring back the grain bowl for purchase—I loved that!.
4754,Nice food.
4755,Not enough choices to purchase food.
4756,"One cookie for first class, please."
4757,Love that you offer AHA. I love Biscoff cookies. Unfortunately they ran out just as they reached our row. Pretzels are an unwelcome replacement. But the flight attendant apologized. I know it was not his fault. It was our connection flight. they did a very quick turnaround and minimized the delay. So they likely did not get there normal snack allotment.
4758,No.
4759,No offer of water later in the flight.
4760,No.
4761,No Coke Zero. Only Diet Coke. I do not like Diet Coke.
4762,The ice cream dessert has dropped in quality over the years. It was rock hard and when i asked to delay serving it i was told that was not possible. Also the bagel and lox as a dinner option was terrible.
4763,U should provide a meal.
4764,The warm nuts were just right!.
4765,It would be great if more variety of items could be available.
4766,The tabouli salad(?). was passed over by people around me. I thought it sad there was so much wasted food. Maybe too exotic?. I ate it.
4767,I was surprised I was offered the whole can.
4768,N/.
4769,.
4770,None.
4771,The choices of the food was not very good on this flight.
4772,What happened to the pretzels/cookies that used to be distributed in the economy cabin?.
4773,The breakfast was not up to par.
4774,Cold bagel.
4775,No.
4776,"MY first flight after covids, need more."
4777,No.
4778,"In my opinion, you should be able to provide a snack for free."
4779,I wish I was offered small pretzels.
4780,Snack was not provided.
4781,No.
4782,"I think that if you are offering snacks in short flights , they should be a better quality and more variarity ."
4783,The only carrier of the big four that does not provide complimentary snacks. Bring back the stroopwafel!.
4784,No.
4785,It was just ok.
4786,I think there should be more than two dinner options. In the breakfast could have hot chocolate.
4787,"Entree was filling and tasty, but rather dry."
4788,"Never any other beer options loaded other than lager, despite IPAs etc being listed."
4789,"For that long of a flight, it would be nice if there were additional complimentary food options that are included in the price."
4790,Flight attendant noticed to ask to refilled my coffee. Very nice.
4791,"I would like to hace latte on the plain, would be amazing."
4792,To receive complementary box without having to ask for it.
4793,smeall great but taste really bad.....
4794,My good experience in United express was significantly better than the Polaris lounge food which is beyond sad.
4795,I would suggest a dessert.
4796,No.
4797,Need a better selection.
4798,The hot turkey sandwich snack was good too. Impressed the flight attendant left the full sized can of soda with me.
4799,No.
4800,Everything was great. we enjoyed the trip. the crew was nice.
4801,They could have offered water later in flight. I know I am asking a lot.
4802,None for this flight.
4803,For some reason I thought when there are over 3 hour flights there was a meal. This was over 5 hours of a flight. I thought more than a cookie would have been nice.
4804,I love your snack boxes!.
4805,No food service. Flight is too short.
4806,The Turkey & cheese was not very good.
4807,No in-flight beverage this flight.
4808,"Very short flight, but water was offered."
4809,Just thank you.
4810,Flight time limited inflight service - no time to drink beverage I realize you have no control of that tho And flight attendants did their best for timely service (I also usually sit closer to the front but I changed my flight and my previously paid for seat in 12D was moved to 32C).
4811,On my flight from NEwark to Frankfurt - they ran out of 2 choices. My choices left we some fish and vegitarian.
4812,Have some other white wine besides Chardonnay.
4813,"Well, atypically my dinner was not good. I picked rib and it was not soft and fatter than normal."
4814,Great service.
4815,We were charged for 2 alcoholic beverages that we did not purchase.
4816,Thanks.
4817,Brioche Burger was *very* good!.
4818,Please upgrade the snacks to have healthy options.
4819,A warm meal would have been preferred.
4820,Need to select a different seltzer brand.
4821,"If there was more choices for the food to be purchased, I would consider the same. On this trip, we bought something at the airport and brought it on board."
4822,it was very good.
4823,"As I have observed in the past, most of the crew have no clue of the wine selection. It is thus difficult to make a choice and not be disappointed. Now LH and SR have a much better information about the wine they offer. this information could be provided online. no need to print a booklet!."
4824,No comments.
4825,No.
4826,Breakfast was cold and rubbery.
4827,Whit wine was off. Got a second glass and it was not off but very poor in taste.
4828,I think it is time to restitute the snack basket or at least more selection in First Class.
4829,Chicken dish was very good.
4830,"If I get some food & drink as complementary, I would be more satisfied. I think. at least few food/ beverage should be complementary."
4831,Maybe a little heavier snack like a sandwich.
4832,I was not aware of an attendant offering water during the flight. I was awake plenty of the time.
4833,It would have been a nice touch to offer a free snack.
4834,"As a 1k member, it was not clear what my options were regarding b a complimentary snack/drink so I did not receive one and was not asked."
4835,The cheese on the cheeseburger only covered ~25% of the burger;. mostly cover the plate.
4836,Yes be consistent with the inflight entertainment. One flight had tvs for viewing the other flight did not. That really sucked.
4837,It was a 50 minute flight so no food/beverage was expected.
4838,see previous comment about need for gluten-free snacks. My Houston to IAD flight had something I could eat [almonds] I was puzzled that the earlier flight did not.
4839,"I was in first class on a shorter RJ flight. The ""self serve"" snack portal was unique, and I liked that they had a variety of options including a small cheese platter!. Very nice amenities on this newer RJ 550, including the luggage rack, snack bar, and larger bathroom."
4840,None.
4841,Would have been nice to have a morning muffin.
4842,"more variety for meals, paying for business class would have liked more options for meals and spiritis (e.g. no tequila)."
4843,I would like a healthier choice. the kale and egg brought back. I have tried to order it but somehow it never goes through on the preorder.
4844,"Need Green Tea ,coffee need bigger suze."
4845,For breakfast I was offered only a hot drink but not water.
4846,Better food.
4847,I prefer more protein.
4848,I wish there were more snacks. better ones available.
4849,"The attendant promptly provided ear phones for us to enjoy a movie, news,etc. Aldo the sparkling water helped in taking our meds. Thks!."
4850,I asked for decaf and it would have been made for me so I passed.
4851,Appreciate the flight staff providing a full serving of beverage.
4852,change ups / additions to snack boxes needed.
4853,We flew first class and only were offered stroopwaffles or pretzels. Not like previous flights.
4854,More than twice during a 5+ hour flight.
4855,No.
4856,Too difficult to order and pay for purchases on United's app. I could not put in my bank credit card. I will not fly with United again.
4857,"Would like to see more meal choice variety in business class for these long flights. Menu and choices were about the same as my flight to Denver several days before and my trip to Chicago in August and flights to Denver in June. Chicken was very tough and hard. I know it is difficult to prepare meals for these flights. However, I would have been happy with a sandwich choice.. Also the bun for the burger on flight was essentially hard toasted."
4858,you should have a better beer selection.
4859,Y.
4860,"glutenbevattende snack serveren bij een glutenvrij maaltijd, tot 2x toe."
4861,Best airline food I have had in years!.
4862,The red and white wine were pretty bad quality.
4863,"More vegan options would be nice, in general."
4864,"credit card info needs to be updated so service is not incorrectly refused by attendants - our attendant returned to our seat apologizing that her info just updated, and we did, in fact, have an updated credit card on file."
4865,What attendance only came by once in a five hour flight.
4866,A larger variety of snacks would help.
4867,The chicken was somewhat a little spicy. I am not sure if this was detailed on the menu.
4868,Really need a bigger snack or meal.
4869,The breakfast choices were good -nice to see the fruit and yoghurt as a starter and the healthier egg shawarma option too.
4870,Better good than the last two times.
4871,No.
4872,Everyone is good.
4873,Seems like free small snacks could be readded to beverage.
4874,There should be more gluten free options and snacks.
4875,excellent.
4876,Pork meal was awful.
4877,There was no service.
4878,The food was not anything special and not the best compared to other airlines.
4879,"A better description of the food items or being able to see what each dish looks like before having to make your choice. I was always among the first in my seating class to order and the short descriptions of either ""chicken"" or ""ravioli"" were not all that helpful. I definitely would have ordered different items if I had more info regarding the dish."
4880,"We flew FC, so, the chicken Katsu was great, and the dessert was very tasty. Now, mind you, this was at 11 pm at night. But, who cares?. Blankets, glasses of wine and a warm meal was all my husband and I needed for a pre-two hour nap."
4881,Better wibes.
4882,"I wanted to comment on the food. I had the burger on the way out... it was okay and the other full meals did not really appeal to me for my flight back. I might like the next rotation of meal selections better... Still, I want to commend United for offering a meal on this short domestic flight MSY to DEN. I also wanted to share that I liked that there were some options offered (snack boxes) in place of the meal... and I really appreciate that the other F&B options were made available complimentary to first class passengers!."
4883,I wanted a burger or hardier meal and this flight did not provide those options. I was only able to get a cheese snack with grapes.
4884,It might be nice if the meal and dessert selections were expanded and/or rotated.
4885,Good meal for us.
4886,Really nice to have a healthy meal offered and quinoa and chicken was tasty and filling!.
4887,No.
4888,Vegetarian meal was only option but turned out delicious.
4889,No.
4890,na.
4891,I do not travel that often but it would help us Seniors to know how to request a snack through using your credit card in advance to purchase what I would like to eat/drink. I did not get a menu eon the website.
4892,Some new meal options would be nice.
4893,Na.
4894,"I am glad to see more vegan options available by default on flights, and staff being aware of ingredients to be able to discuss/advise as needed."
4895,When I checked in online I did not know I can choose vegetarian options … Also I choose French toast for breakfast and they did not have it … already.
4896,The size of food amount is small.
4897,The contactless payment has been difficult for me to arrange.
4898,Food options are repetitive for frequent flyers.
4899,not much.
4900,Nope.
4901,How can you reduce the number of one-use plastic items on board?. I usually say no to drink offers because I do not want to drink 4 ounces of liquid and then throw away the cup.
4902,Was under the impression lunch and or dinner will be served.
4903,There was no option to purchase alcohol.
4904,There use to be more food choices.
4905,No.
4906,Improve the food.
4907,I would like a still flavored water option.
4908,contactless program is a pain and not easily utilized by clients my age... My flight ( coach) was almost $11000.00. There surely is a better way to order spirits etc .
4909,"Meals were tasty, but the number of meals was limited (only three pasta meals) so that limited our choice."
4910,Would like flavored sparkling water.
4911,"I chose the chicken, because the ingredients for the impossible meat is not good for human consumption, in my opinion."
4912,I was happy with everything.
4913,Good selection.
4914,There could have been more options especially for a 17 hour flight .. the food portion was small.
4915,It would be nice to get decaf and sugar free options.
4916,I recommend United Airlines offer chardonnay wine.
4917,Hope to have a snack beside the soda.
4918,Kosher choices for snacks would be nice.
4919,Love the zero options.
4920,No.
4921,"Did not drink any alcohol, but enjoyed the option to have free alcoholic beverages in first class."
4922,No.
4923,Warm food for purchase.
4924,No.
4925,It is a long flight - at dinner time - Not to have either a substantial complimentary snack or more (healthy) options for purchase.
4926,Do not offer chicken and then tell us you ran out and only have vegetarian. You know what you need because we pre order.
4927,El pollo estaba horrible.
4928,I appreciate that the burger was hot. But bun was not great at all as it probably was over toasted. The burger was filling.
4929,"this was a long haul with bfast also. was in Polaris, and the egg frittata (I think that was what it was called) was not very good. would rather have more options, even if cereal."
4930,I did not request the breakfast. I would have chosen the waffle had regular syrup been provided. I would have chose the omelet had it not included the vegetables mixed in. Instead I had a nice chocolate chip muffin in the terminal prior to boarding. ;. ).
4931,Please see my opening comment. The info is there.
4932,Slow clean up after snack.
4933,Would have preferred a lunch rather than a late breakfast. We saved some yogurt from our meal to eat later as we knew we would be hungry.
4934,"As a frequent First Class passenger for United, I would really appreciate a greater level of meals for each flight. The cheese board is wonderful, and should always be an option for purchase. I make a point to purchase First Class to gain assistance in my busy schedule. I would like to be able to stop and have a substantial meal during the First Class flight. It allows me to continue quickly through the rest of the day and week."
4935,Offer more for long flughts.
4936,They did not have pretzels or any other sugar free snack. They only had apple juice I usually get cranberry juice.
4937,Do not try so hard on the food. Way too many exotic flavors and spices. Keep it [food] simple and quality.
4938,"i flew Swiss in June from Zurich to LAX, it is heads and shoulder above United. I look forward to a return to the meal served in courses. a decent salad is required. I got a soba noodle dish as the ""salad"" - the packaged ice cream was tacky, please bring back the sundae cart - United needs to work on its food for Polaris."
4939,The quality and flavor of the meals were excellent for an economy faire. Far exceeded expectations.
4940,Breakfast was questionable!.
4941,Great job designing/developing the chicken/spinach/orzo meal.
4942,"In Polaris - main entree - one vegetarian option - somewhat bland, not particularly to my liking - have had much nicer meals on precious flights."
4943,"Very short flight so only beverages offered in first class. Even though I was sitting in seat 1A. the attendant walked by me at least four times serving others but did not offer me a drink. I did not bother to ask given the short duration of the flight, but think I should have been asked regardless."
4944,"For the price of tickets, do not feel I should have to pay for a meal. Or, I would rather you charge me $10 more for the ticket and have meals onboard."
4945,No.
4946,None.
4947,was not expecting complementary snacks!. Very nice to have.
4948,The chicken dish is getting old I fly a lot.
4949,"A little spicy, and cooled quickly due to a/c."
4950,No gluten free options at all for people who have severe allergies.
4951,Decaffeinated teas would be appreciated.
4952,"For a nine hour flight we were served lunch and a small snack an hour before landing but nothing in between. A small basket of potato chips and water were left on the shelf in front of our seats for passengers to select if they chose. not what we would expect for a long flight. Fruit, cheese, small snack would be nice."
4953,No.
4954,We did not have any choice between pretzel and the other stuff?. Peanut would have been better!.
4955,Miss the meals we use to get in coach.
4956,No.
4957,It is a very short flight. Not much time for service. What I had was enough.
4958,This part of trip was excellent.
4959,No.
4960,The total meal is one plate less than years ago. The appetizer is missing. the whole meal is brought on one tray. The plates used to be serviced individually when you were ready for it. The total dinner experience is not nearly to the level of prior years. Makes me wonder what the fight attendants do with their extra time now sine they have less to do.
4961,No.
4962,Larger beer selection and more snack variety please.
4963,"They should add variety of snacks, the lunch or dinner would be better hot not cold."
4964,"The chicken was a bit over done, so a bit dry, but okay. The roll appeared to not have risen enough. was more like a biscuit."
4965,No.
4966,"Again, I would like to see consistency. Our preflight drink was limited to just water. Would like to see consistency. Two preflight drink options and regular cups instead of plastic during inflight service."
4967,For the cost of flights today we should have been given the entire can of juice.
4968,Short flights have usually served a snack (pretzels/stroopwaffel). there was none served on this flight. A small snack would have been good as I had not brought food onboard assuming a small snack was provided.
4969,The only problem was it was difficult to eat because of the small space at our seat.
4970,No food was fair.
4971,Nope.
4972,Bringing back snacks would be good.
4973,Lacking a baked item (e.g. croissant or cinnamon roll).
4974,Highly priced.
4975,Should be more than cookies.
4976,No snacks offered with the beverages.
4977,The snack boxes are great!.
4978,You guys did not have Coke Zero you had coke. Other than that it was fine.
4979,Too short of flight to eat but I did have coffee (good) and the service was great.
4980,Too expensive ($9 for a 175 ml bottle of wine). Would appreciate other white wine options such as Pino Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc. I missed the last call for trash discarding because I had a window seat and was blocked by two larger size passengers. I thought I should have been asked/checked.
4981,Better free snacks.
4982,Please make online boarding for non carry on & check bags passengers as well. Seats are not comfortable.
4983,Please provide Dr. Pepper.
4984,I was not aware that water was available on my flights.
4985,Offer something other the black tea for people preferring no caffeine drinks on a night flight.
4986,I think in first class you should at least offer a sandwich option for a flight that is over two hours.
4987,I was not given the option of pretzels.
4988,Not really. The length of the flight is too short to offer any food or beverage service.
4989,No.
4990,No.
4991,Not really.
4992,"There were 3 snacks listed however, we were only offered 2. I personally like the stroowaffle(I hope I spelled correctly)."
4993,No.
4994,Ridiculous choices for the price of the glight.
4995,If you do not preorder there were really no choices.
4996,No.
4997,Wine choices were slim.
4998,Water or soda should be free.
4999,My coffee was good.
5000,"Realize it was a short flight but when you serve beverages, United could at least give us cookies or pretzels."
5001,Serving water in small bottles would be nice.
5002,No food and/or beverages served.
5003,A portion of my food was frozen… not a good experience in that… my kid had the regular meal and the options were not something to be proud of.
5004,Come by more often.
5005,I appreciated the meal but it was dry Chicken on dry lettuce and quinoa it would have been nice to have a packet of dressing. The beverages were not offered very often and mostly we were just given cups of water if we had been asked more often I would have bought more drinks of soda even if they were not complimentary just to have something other than water. No snacks were offered after the meal. again I would have liked to be asked more frequently if I wanted to buy snacks.
5006,Would like to see different variety of meals re same chicken same vegan Would prefer a menu change more frequent.
5007,"The meal menu needs choices chicken, vegtables, or beef."
5008,"I would have appreciated the United app confirming that the gluten free meal was attached to my ticket. Also the gluten free ""bread"" was dry, hard and unacceptable with poor flavor. I, of course, could not eat the salad with it is white potatoes. The granola bar for breakfast was so cold out made it too hard to bite into. Rice and vegetable dinner was ok and fortunately not a spicy as out flight from Chicago to Rekjavick."
5009,"Again, the comp snacks do not include any GF option...it would be nice to have something."
5010,No.
5011,It was fine.
5012,no.
5013,Compared to other Airlines your food is very low quality.
5014,Most flights offer a snack. I noticed United does not.
5015,I would like a little bottle of water at boarding. On a flight from Houston to DC it was offered and I was so grateful because I had forgotten my water bottle. The flight from Houston to Portland 9/9 I had to wait for water and was not happy. The coffee could have been stronger <:-)>!.
5016,Nice offering a tray of snacks that you could take what you wanted.
5017,Quinoa salad does not taste good.
5018,Everything was very good. The only negative comment I have is that opening the ketchup packet was like breaking into Fort Knox.
5019,The options do not change very often.
5020,The Waffle provided for breakfast was extremely sweet and saggy. Not that appetizing. I think I would have preferred pancakes. Thanks.
5021,"Very basic beverages, just cookies. Very unhappy about it."
5022,No.
5023,No complaints.
5024,Food taste was just okay. Need to have more snacks available for people to take during the flight.
5025,"Although the dinner was ok, the sandwich just before we landed was excellent. Do away with meal and serve hot sandwiches!."
5026,Tasty.
5027,fa was great.
5028,No Club Service area at Cancun airport. Was not given the option to pre-order meal for the return flight from Cancun to SFO so chicken selection was no longer available.
5029,You should offer people cookies and nuts.
5030,none.
5031,only pretzels - no drinks served.
5032,hand out a free snack packet!.
5033,"The coffee was so good. I flied for 3 hours. I think you can offer sandwiches or meat plates, also salads maybe!."
5034,The United Club in Chicago should offer better breakfast food.
5035,no snacks- I was in first class.
5036,"I have flown on the route to London for years and many times. I can not remember when the meal choices were different in Biz class. Same thing every time … beef short rib, chicken etc. it feels like United has gotten lazy and cheap."
5037,No.
5038,"Disappointed, no snacks being in premium economy."
5039,no.
5040,"Second meal I choose the vegetable curry. It was very tasteless. Even with salt and pepper added, it did not taste of anything. No curry."
5041,no.
5042,More variety for meals for purchase.
5043,"Breakfast was poor. Chobani yoghurt was great. the croissant was not nutritious, and tough to chew. Some fresh fruit would have been better."
5044,I wish the breakfast meal had options. I do not eat pork so I could not eat a lot of what was served.
5045,Ultra.
5046,I kind of expected a tiny snack along with the soft drink. But this is not a big deal by any means.
5047,There was no food or beverage served in my flight which was complimentary.
5048,Rice with chicken VERY spicy.
5049,Your red wine was so bad that I did not finish drinking it and gave it [wine] back.
5050,"The AHA sparkling blueberry water, it is some thing I always look forward to, when I fly United!."
5051,I had my credit card information in my app and I was unable to use it . I did not asked for help from the flight attendant but I felt like it was a little confusing and that is why I did not want to get any drinks.
5052,I would like an entire can not a tiny cup full.
5053,No.
5054,Bring back the Stroop waffle cookies and let me have two!.
5055,Had a very good breakfast in first class.
5056,Like it platinum or gold members got some of the food opportunities a 1K get sitting in economy.
5057,There should be some snack available for the kids.
5058,Would appreciate more variety.
5059,The beef entree while tasty was full of gristle so half of it was not edible.
5060,They should provide the menu so that we are able to decide quick.
5061,More vegetarian options.
5062,They only offered one beverage on the flight which was over three hours. I am used to at least another offer of water.
5063,The very same meals were offered on my flights in June and on my both my recent flights!. Changing the meal offerings more frequently.
5064,A 3+ hpur flight could have had more of a snack. It left a bit after 1 so a late lunch would have been appreciated as we were waiting in the terminal during lunchtime.
5065,Healthier more tasteful options please.
5066,Que ofrezcan.
5067,Scrambled eggs were very good.
5068,Better selection of desserts.
5069,No.
5070,No acknowledgement of our 1k status or offer to Provide a cocktail and/ Or snack.
5071,Good overall flavour and portion size.
5072,No.
5073,I ordered a meal on line and it was not available on the flight. Other choices were mediocre.
5074,It was not the food and beverage itself but that you want me to save my credit card information on your app. There needs to be a better way. I will not save that in your app.
5075,There was no food or beverages served on the flight.
5076,No.
5077,Impossible meatball is quite good but really loved the cheeseburger on the flight out to California.
5078,Folks distributing were very nice. I was not hungry or thirsty.
5079,Snacks.
5080,The options for food was better for our flight from SF to Chicago.
5081,none served.
5082,No.
5083,Delicious cookies.
5084,Only offered water.
5085,Very good and had decaf coffe.
5086,I chose N/A on so many of my answers because the food chosen prior to the flight was not on the flight.
5087,would have liked another option for hot food.
5088,flying to Maui I had a choice of a continental breakfast and chose that;. going back that was not an option so I had to choose one of the two main courses just to get the same continental breakfast (croissant fruit and yogurt). Continental should always be an option.
5089,Need to improve food choices in general on business and first class flights. On short medium and long hauls.
5090,Food-poor snack choices-easy to have a small bag of nuts or crackers as choices as well and better for diabetics. Some protein is a much better choice. Biscotti cookies are dry and unhealthy.
5091,Ran out of snack choices.
5092,Food on Premier class needs improvement.
5093,Expected items not available.
5094,"I am pleased so many of us were able to use our personal, reusable containers."
5095,Very nice.
5096,This was the first flight where not even a tiny bag of pretzels or cookies was provided. Good thing we brought our own!. Long time in a plane with nothing to eat otherwise.
5097,"Very short flight, understand that it is tough to include a more involved food service on a sub 60 minute flight."
5098,Pretty skimpy and items for sale were disappointing.
5099,It was so nice to be offered snacks along with the beverage.
5100,No.
5101,Coffee was warm. Liquid creamer is a good gesture.
5102,there was none. I did not expect any.
5103,Other airlines have offered warm nuts before meal service and also a dessert. My meal was breakfast. a sweet treat later in the flight would be nice for First Class guests.
5104,Food of poor quality.
5105,The timing was perfect!.
5106,I was not given a napkin which I needed one to wipe my hands.
5107,"I was very pleased with the food service;. and, the taste, selection offered, and adequacy was excellent."
5108,The Pretzels are as hard as a rock. everything else is full of sugar.
5109,No….
5110,There were no choices to pick we were just handed a carmel cookie.
5111,"you only had sugar. I would have like the pretzels. So I did not eat anything and I was hungry. My fault. I should have brought something on board, but Southwest always has something salty so I did not even think that sugar would be the only choice."
5112,It was all good.
5113,I have nothing to since I did not eat on that flight.
5114,Attendant did not take a order for coffee.
5115,"Meal selection was limited to two. I pre-selected the chicken but received the other one, which was pasta with something on it. Not sure why. Taste was ok but not great. Dessert was some sort of tart on the tray. Again, just ok. Fruit cup was fresh."
5116,More free food.
5117,"The pasta dish was ok, edible but nothing special. I was hungry so ate it. The chocolate tart for dessert was good as was the fruit."
5118,No.
5119,Really did not need anything for such a short flight. Little snacks just fine.
5120,It is good.
5121,"Thank you for the new variety. For those of us who fly often, we appreciate having some new choices."
5122,"in my humble opinion, on a cross country flight, a complementary meal and cockatiels are in order, not just in business class."
5123,It was a short flight. no food or beverages were served.
5124,No.
5125,Not enough water served as a matter of course. No drinks offered for a long time after takeoff despite normal conditions.
5126,The pasta was mashy.
5127,Taste and choice was fine. On a 3 hour flight it would be nice if a secondary water service was offered. Especially when coming from such a dry environment such as Las Vegas.
5128,None.
5129,No food or beverage service is offered since it is such a short flight.
5130,"Yes, after first pass on water, we kept asking for more water as the cabin was unusually warm. We only got 2 small glasses the whole flight."
5131,Coffee always luke warm on United.
5132,The service was performed very well.
5133,"I had the same meal going and on the return flight from Denver to Kona. Going to Kona, the chicken was so tough I could not eat/cut it. On the return trip it was more moist and could be cut."
5134,"Burger bun was dried out like stale toast. For $10, expected little more and better quality."
5135,My takeoff box was missing the gouda spread. The injustice. But it was seriously.
5136,Everything we asked for was available.
5137,Food was bland. presentation was not so appealing.
5138,Stroopwafels are the best!!!!.
5139,"No, all was good."
5140,The meal served was rediculously small.
5141,Missing nuts or cookie.
5142,Not applicable.
5143,The food choices were disappointing.
5144,"I was disappointed the beverages were US origin (eg, HFCS in the Coca-Cola soft drinks). was not clear if there were spirits options. Wine was pretty low-end."
5145,Breakfast was disappointing. Sausage and eggs was barbecue sausage and a baked scrambled egg. Inedible. Luckily there was yogurt and croissant that were good.
5146,I did not remember to ask ahead of time for a meal without dairy. all the regular options had dairy so I was not able to eat much.
5147,The food was not very tasty.
5148,Pretzels seemed hard?. Stale???. Biscoff cookies always good!!.
5149,you need more variety.
5150,"Again, I miss the cereal/granola/yogurt/fruit option."
5151,No decaf tea was available.
5152,"I take my own food and drinks aboard aircraft, except Air France and Lufthansa."
5153,"As mentioned before, I chose the sundae but it [sundae] has nothing to do with the one UA used to serve before COVID... we used to elect the toppings (many) and the quantity to be poured. Also, the ice cream was smoother than the one being served. About the wine, we used to have a list of pre-selected wines, indicating the producer, year, type of grape, etc. These days they ask you ""red"" or ""white"" and we have to ask for a grape but no idea what wine was served, region, etc. Unfortunately the ""quality"" and the nice feeling of learning, understanding and choosing is gone at UA."
5154,Again the attitude is more i. portant than the food/beverage. If the flight rates are same as delta than service should also e competitive. No sanitizer was offered at boarding.
5155,More ice than soda.
5156,No but hope they offered a incredible kid pack last plane was terrible.
5157,Larger portions and more meals should be provided for a flight that is almost 11 hours.
5158,Did not have Stroopwaffles.
5159,"after not doing much travel during covid - the mechanism(s) for paying for items like beer seemed to be limited for folks without some ""app.""."
5160,"The beef jerky is fine with me for flights within the continental US, for longer flights it would be nice if United could add choices for people with dietary restrictions."
5161,No free snack inflight is a but surprising.
5162,There is no snack. I remembered we could get a small snack before Covid.
5163,Short llight. No food or beverage.
5164,I think we still need a light meal service.
5165,It would be nice to be able to choose the snack.
5166,Would like to see dr. Pepper added to the soda selections.
5167,"So the lady beside me, who is not a frequent united flyer, got a complimentary beverage because she ""could not figure out the app"" yet I am penalized because I have my credit card stored...."
5168,Not the one from Chicago but the one going to Rome.
5169,The pre-purchased meal options are lacking. Need better choices.
5170,The meals served was very good.
5171,No.
5172,Would have liked at least some crackers or something like on SWA.
5173,More beverages.
5174,Flight attendant Adam was awesome!.
5175,Dessert was served on the same tray as the meal so therefore no choice nor was the portion size adequate or explained (it was on the same plate as the bread). There were no snacks prior to the meal. before landing (like Delta does). there was no bottle of water at the seat (like Delta does).
5176,I am speaking in general with other fly but this last fly from Newark to San Juan was bigger plane and more comfortable.
5177,"Food was not served during the flight. however, I intended to purchase some."
5178,No.
5179,"Staff are not educated regarding food allergies and do not offer any options for snacks. I was offered pretzels, but am allergic to wheat. No other option was offered. I was also given a biscotti with breakfast. I asked if it was gluten free and was told not to eat it if I did not want it. On an overnight flight, it is hard to read labels on food and would appreciate if I check gluten intolerant, that all food items offered to me were safe."
5180,No comment.
5181,I had pre-ordered a snack and was charged for the one that I ordered on the plane. Now I have two charges on my credit card and I have to call United to fix the issue.
5182,No like pretzels <😊>.
5183,My favorite drinks on board so I loved it!.
5184,We fly United often and it is always the same snack. Can you mix it up a bit?.
5185,we were never offered refills after the meals.
5186,I was not thrilled with the snack box.
5187,"I would love to see more diverse sugar free drink offerings. please none with Aspartame!. For example, AHA was available and I tried it for the first time but it was not very good. Have you considered offering Zevia?. The caffeine free ginger ale and grape flavors are great. 0 calories and they have a really good taste - much better than AHA or the sugar beverages offered. I will not even touch Coke products anymore because everything is filled with so much sugar or unhealthy ingredients. Also to add, I can not ever find decaf tea on flights. I have asked the last four trips, including in first class and it was not available. I like a hot beverage in the afternoon but will not drink anything with caffeine after 1/2 PM or it keeps me up at night. Food wise, I see the variety of healthy snacks is growing. I think there is significant work to be done still. This is an issue across ALL airports in the country where true healthy food is difficult to find. I understand that the snacks have to appeal to a wide range of travelers. you will not make money. I would love to see some products like Buddha popcorn or Gimme Seaweed or Smart Sweets candy."
5188,"Please stop with those disgusting boxed meals. They are an assortment of random crap and create nothing but more waste for landfill sites. Who really gets excited about fig spread, two crackers, some breadsticks, and dried apricots!?. I would much rather a return to hot meal options (hopefully better quality than when you had them pre-COVID). I am sure there is an excellent financial opportunity in providing something decent if it was hot and tasty. Unfortunately, my flight from PVR to DEN was stuck on the tarmac for about 40 minutes, while waiting for two other planes to depart from their gates so we could park. That delay caused my layover in DEN to be too short to buy something at a restaurant prior to boarding. I was lucky to get through customs, check my bag, get through TSA, and to my gate in time, so was stuck with inflight meal options. Very disappointing."
5189,"Having option to pre-order would be great as many people did not receive their first choice meal, including myself. Pre-order would allow people to get exactly what they want and reduce service issues for the flight attendants."
5190,"The food choices up front have not really changed in years. Even a simple turkey sandwich or PNJ would be a welcomed change. (Note that the current variety is very good, well prepared, and served. Even the club rooms seems to change it up. Just saying. )."
5191,No.
5192,Best food I have had on a premium plus seat.
5193,Add ben and Jerrys small ice creams <:)>.
5194,They were out of a beer I wanted.
5195,Awesome.
5196,"Although only choice was curry ( vegetable or chicken) it was absolutely delicious, ice cream was amazing, toasted sandwich before landing was great too. A pleasant surprise."
5197,"For the business/first class it is always the same options, I travel to Mexico two times a month, more variety would be nice."
5198,No.
5199,No nuts or chips was offer.
5200,not too much to talk about a stoopwaffle.
5201,Would like to have Pinot Grigio as an option.
5202,Food purchase only through app.
5203,N/a.
5204,Good.
5205,"No food served, its just a short flight."
5206,Can offer a snack.
5207,Do not serve spicy food.
5208,Add option to choose cracker & mixed nuts.
5209,Short flights do not offer the service.
5210,A snack item would be a good step forward.
5211,Nice to see dinner return to IAH to SAN flights and even nicer to provide dinner on flight after 8pm.
5212,Time to swap out first class meals - rotation been way too long. Waffle and Zatar chicken <🤮>.
5213,No cookies or wafers serve.
5214,"Strange combinations. For example, chicken with cheese. Salad side was not appetizing. No beverage was offered in between first hot meal served not long after take off to almost an hour before we landed. Never saw a flight attendant."
5215,"The first & primary meal was fine, although I did not get my preferred selection. The second meal/snack was poor. Chicken burger filled with small amount of crushed gristle & dry, tough chocolate cookie that could break a tooth!. Just trying to give you straight feedback."
5216,Ore selection of craft beer would be nice. Need a snack on a long flight.
5217,N/A.
5218,Need to have a gluten free option.
5219,Same as above you took away peanuts for allergies but then those of us who have a gluten allergy do not get a snack because you give cookies or pretzels.
5220,The main breakfast was the first time in over thirty years of traveling primarily with UA that my wife and I found the food just really unappealing.
5221,"More variations, same options if you fly often."
5222,No snacks at all.
5223,No.
5224,Everything was good no complaints.
5225,No.
5226,"Its really disappointing that a snack is only a bag of pretzels for a nearly 3 hour flight. To have anything more or healthier, customers must buy an expensive snack pack."
5227,Too short and too small craft.
5228,Ok no meal was provided. small snacks would have been nice.
5229,The pork dish was fine with the exception of the sweet potatoes. Terrible taste.
5230,Ok.
5231,no.
5232,No it was a very good flight.
5233,Would like iced tea to be offered.
5234,I received 2 small bowls of the same white rice which was odd (1 was hot & 1 was cold). The dessert was a pack of 2 small chocolate covered macadamia nuts that was already on the tray with the meal.
5235,They do not want to sell alcohol. I do not know why I have credit and debit card and cash. You guys don take any.
5236,Offer variety of mid flight snacks.
5237,As mentioned a second food service of cookies ice cream something and there should be a better selection of wines one white wine does not cut it.
5238,"The breakfest startet something too late, that the Landing at FRA Pressed passengers and service."
5239,Food temperature was perfect. portion size was good. Overall very happy. I am not usually able to eat on flights because of the starches or carbs. I can only have protein and zero sugar. So the eggs with cheese was perfect.
5240,"I was disappointed that I was not offered a snack on this flight. I sat in first class and had a cocktail, but was not offered any snacks."
5241,"There was no dressing for the salad. I had the tofu noodles. Everything else was fine. I was happy to have a vegetarian option. I was also happy that food was offered - before the flight, the app said food for purchase but the website said meals provided so I was not sure what was going to be offered."
5242,Service was good.
5243,"For some reason, I was not offered a beverage on the flight. Also, I thought the offering of pretzels for a 06:00 flight in First Class was a bit strange."
5244,As a large person I would not mind the option to get 2 entrees.
5245,"It would be wonderful if United keeps a stock of kids food for flight, like french fries and chicken fingers, as kids are always particular about food."
5246,"We ordered two burgers, a little bit warm outside and totally cold on the inside. Like fresh from the fridge."
5247,No.
5248,No snack choice. Wish there was a low carb higher protein option.
5249,For a first class/ Polaris ticket I would have expected to not run out of one of the two only options especially being in row 6. That was disappointing. Also plenty of beverages but I had to ask the flight attendants who mainly remained in the galleys.
5250,I was not able to purchase additional food or beverages because the app did not work for me.
5251,The amount of food was fine. With the time of day taken into consideration everything was as it should be.
5252,Food was good for the situation.
5253,Vegetarian options are usually pasta which is not great under the circumstances of prepping for flights. Would love to see more interesting options.
5254,Keep up the good job.
5255,None.
5256,Not enough water. Water is not expensive so why are they so stingy giving out super tiny cups of water like it is expensive.
5257,When you ask for water on a 4 hour flight a tiny tiny cup is not really enough. Larger cups or small bottles should be given because it is easy to get dehydrated quickly on long flights.
5258,No Diet Sprite or 7-up.
5259,Food was acceptable for airline meal.
5260,"Please bring back more gluten free options that you had before the pandemic. On the bright side, the hummus and quinoa snack offered on this flight was delicious and fit a variety of dietary restrictions such as gluten free (without the crackers), dairy free, and vegetarian. I suggest more meals and snacks that by their nature/ingredients already fit many dietary restrictions in one meals so that you can save money and keep more passengers happy."
5261,It would be nice to offer some kind of real food versus junk food. Coffee was sour tasting.
5262,No.
5263,They ran out of lotus - crackers I like.
5264,Thanks to the flight attendants.
5265,"For someone who has to avoid dairy products, it was not that easy: The chicken meal had some cheese on it and the breakfast snack was a yoghurt with a biscotti."
5266,No.
5267,The burger looked and tasted very bad.
5268,No.
5269,not really.
5270,No snack.
5271,Melted ice cream was given. Sandwich was not heated properly. Inside was still cold.
5272,"Yes, a minor issue, but the white wines were limited;. only got (a single glass) of Sauvignon Blanc after requesting it. Sure, expected in Prem. Econ, but not in Bus Class."
5273,"Bread stick is not tasty, no choice, poor choice on your part."
5274,No snack was offered.
5275,We enjoyed your vegetarian choices. We were flying business. the food seems better than in the past.
5276,"I had entered my credit card online, for each member of my family flying in, but the attendent would not accept my card for them to purchase in-flight beverages because my name on the credit card did not match the traveler's. I did not see anywhere on the United website that said the names had to match. Not the biggest concern, but I was trying to spoil my family, and United missed out on making some sales because of that policy."
5277,"There were only a very small pouch of pretzels available. Given the delays, it would be good to offer a few different options and portion sizes."
5278,Better on Luftansa.
5279,I would like to have free hard liquors.
5280,No.
5281,The menu seems the same for a long time. A change will be great.
5282,I think there should be a complimentary snack for everyone.
5283,"I am 1k and flying in first class, confuses me why there would not be a gluten free option. Meanwhile if I fly in economy. I have the complimentary snack option and can obtain GF. If I ask for GF in first class, there is about a 75% chance they offer to check in the cart in the back. A few are confused and and few difficult. It would seem an easy fix for admin to set the FA's up for success with standard option and friendly customer service for those of us who need this option."
5284,Hot food was not appetizing to youth.
5285,I was happier when you could make purchase on the plane with credit cards.
5286,United should partner with a different vendor such as hello fresh to create meals with more flavor.
5287,"For business class, the choice is limited. Also compared to other airlines business class, all the food (except dessert) was served at the same time. i.e. if you eat the salad first, the entre is cool/cold. The rolls could be heated. Am I fussy - No. Do I like things done well - yes!!."
5288,Would be nice to have more brut champagne options.
5289,"Having more selection, bottle of water available for purchase. Out of a lot of things."
5290,You have vegetarian options but now keto/low carb options -- fake chorizo in the egg scramble does not count as keto!.
5291,I think for longer flights you need more than what was offered.
5292,Never was asked for a refill or water.
5293,"More zero calorie options, like sparking flavored waters."
5294,Impressed with the variety of beverages offered at regular intervals.
5295,"Please, offer foods that are dairy free. Some of us do not eat milk products."
5296,Meals served were adequate.
5297,"I had to wait for someone to ask me, which rarely happened. I would have preferred to be able to request service through an app on the plane. Something like what other airlines do on flights this long. Just saying."
5298,"Not complaining , but I would have enjoyed a snack for this flight ."
5299,Washington DC to Frankfurt services were excellent. Frankfurt to Washington DC services were not. I did not receive my kosher meal. I was not told why. 8 or 9 hrs I went without eating.
5300,Why did United take away the half and half for coffee and only have milk as an option. Very unhappy with this.
5301,Food from SFO to MSY is fine. The food from MSY to SFO is not.
5302,I hope as disappointed that hot tea was not offered.
5303,No.
5304,Should go back to serving some type of bread or roll with breakfast.
5305,Coffee pot was having issues but flight attendant kept me updated and served it as soon as possible.
5306,"Food was just ok. Again Swiss was better. Better taste, more variety and more snacks."
5307,The quantity needs to get better.
5308,"Everything was well prepared and tasty, included portions from all food groups, and served with a smile."
5309,Something more substantial.
5310,For business class you could have better quality.
5311,No it was not available. It was just snacks not good.
5312,"Just keep up what a person respecting United First Cabin benefits would be deserving of. If you fly First, then you know what is desired and appreciated."
5313,I am not a great fan of the snack boxes - it would be nice to have some selection of sandwiches or similar product which is fresh especially on a five plus hour flight.
5314,"Just a little more variety!. If you can not bring back the snack basket, then please rotate the selection just a bit. I fly enough so the lack of variety is noticed."
5315,In first class only one offer for breakfast . Departure was so late 10:45 pm not likely to eat dinner and was looking forward to a nicer breakfast than pancakes. Croissant was old and not very good.
5316,Meatballs were terrible.
5317,"THE SKY HOSTESS WAS JOVIAL, KIND, AND CONSIDERATE!."
5318,you must offer at least twice soft drinks in a 430hrs flght.
5319,The cookies not good.
5320,"No, it was fine for the short flight."
5321,You need to quickly go back to offering more hot foods. Over reliance on the snack boxes even on flights over 3 hours is poor and inadequate.
5322,the food was not very tasty. We had sherbert on way over to Amsterdam and it was very soft. For me food was too spicy.
5323,Please bring back cheese plates for purchase. This option was not available on this flight.
5324,Lemonade would be nice or hot cocoa.
5325,no.
5326,"Given the cost of flying, a bit higher quality of complimentary offerings would be welcome."
5327,"Better Wine, more freshness in food. Seafood options and better breakfast. We love Lufthansa food severe."
5328,I just think the snacks could be a little better our airfare was $1000.00 for the 2 of us. I just think there could be something better then pretzels and biscuit cookie.
5329,Did not like orange juice. Milk in coffee was not great.
5330,no cookies or snack.
5331,"I have eaten the Denver scramble before and it was quite good. It [scramble] is usually served piping hot which adds to the breakfast experience. Unfortunately, my Denver scramble for this particular flight was barely at room temperature, which downgraded the breakfast meal."
5332,It would be better if you could purchase a sandwich instead of just snacks.
5333,I had not preordered a snack. They brought them to people in my row and moved on. I was not asked if I wanted anything to eat.
5334,I watched an older gentleman in 20D steal a burger from the snack cart and hide it in the seat pocket in front of him while the attendant was distracted with helping someone else. He then quickly ate it after the snack cart passed and threw the wrapped away in the bathroom. Wild.
5335,pretzels were stale.
5336,The flight took off in the morning. we were only served breakfast. For such a long flight I thought we would also get lunch or a snack since we landed at 3:30pm.
5337,Need more choices. The Chicken dish sides were not tasty.
5338,Menú variado.
5339,None.
5340,Snacks.
5341,I would like to be offered a whole can of sparkling water And not just a cup where I have to get up and ask for a refill.
5342,"When ice cream or sorbet is served with the meal, it melts before you begin to eat it. So I did not eat mine."
5343,No.
5344,It would be nice to have a nut option. On this flight there was no pretzel option.
5345,Above comments are regarding EWR - FCO.
5346,Loved the pre departure beverage.
5347,More options would be great. But thatsbit.
5348,Thanks.
5349,Love the options.
5350,A gluten free option is needed.
5351,The flight was very good.
5352,More selection and meal service for international flights. 1st was served a meal. I thought we would be too (international). Also the drinks were not complimentary.
5353,Be great to have gluten free options.
5354,"Kind of basic offering and offered in a ""transactional"" mode rather than an elevated experience. Well below Lufthansa, SIA, Qatar, Turkish Airlines. No menu card offered. Polaris lounge has improved over United Club. not in the same class as the lounges offered by the airlines above."
5355,More variety. You keep serving the same two meals as options. There have to be better options than the chicken meal you keep serving.
5356,Coffee was not hot enough.
5357,Vegan dinner meal (Rice and veggie curry) from Athens to Dulles was truly outstanding. Follow-up cheese sandwich as second meal was not good. Meal from DC to SFO was a joke—tiny bag of pretzels. Are you kidding me?.
5358,Can you provide more healthy snacks?. Like protein bars?.
5359,very good.
5360,Service was great.
5361,Snacks were small and they only gave you one tiny snack on a 4 hour flight.
5362,"Only one option for an IPA beer and there are much better breweries out there, especially a flight originating in San Diego could have a local brewery supply the beer on board."
5363,I know it is hard to do. the choices are just not very appetizing.
5364,"They gave out snacks, but nothing gluten-free."
5365,There was no food or beverage offered.
5366,On time departure.
5367,My husband (handicapped) and I were in first class - which we always travel - and the food options are limited. If you want any beverage other than the initial service (during the cross country flight) - you need to ring the flight attendant or get up and ask for it. Honestly surprised the staff does not go through first class and ask if anyone wants an additional beverage. The food entrees are very limited.
5368,The food selection could be improved given I had paid business class so expected a bit more.
5369,i brought my own water bottle. there is never an issue when i need a beverage anyway.
5370,A variety with peanuts or pretzels would have been welcomed.
5371,We were given very limited food options -- an egg sandwich for breakfast and then a burger for lunch. The other item available for lunch was a vegetarian option. Do not think two sandwiches should be offered. Would have preferred a chicken dish with vegetables or something more healthy.
5372,I just get a water. But snacks that you provide were not really good. You need to improve the quality and quantity.
5373,AVML meal needed improvement.
5374,Consider not charging for spirits for those in economy plus.
5375,They said no time to serve coffee or cold drinks.
5376,More healthy options please.
5377,"Great tasting, perfect size and heathy."
5378,Read my comment in previous segment.
5379,Poor choice of for purchase snacks.
5380,Ran out of red wine.
5381,I miss the nuts or something crunchy with my cold drink.
5382,Excellent snack selection. Especially cheese plate.
5383,snack box was missing a spoon for the cheese and spread.
5384,Why do US airline companies have same snacks?. Cookies and pretzels?!. Whose idea is that?!.
5385,This part was ok.
5386,No complimentary snack was offered. Passengers were disappointed.
5387,No.
5388,No food. It is a short flight so not a big deal. a stroopwaffle or biscoff cookies are nice.
5389,"The portion size of the fruit and cheese plate was LAUGHABLY small. It used to be bigger!. I counted 9 grapes and 5 small crackers. Come on, United -- that is extremely poor value for the price I paid."
5390,Would be nice to have the small free snack with the drink.
5391,Taste was excellent.
5392,Small complimentary snack should be provided with drink.
5393,"No, everything was ok!."
5394,"Maintain the high food standards, taste and services."
5395,No.
5396,Yes. Gluten Free does not mean Vegetarian. The curry could easily have been chicken or another meat. The second meal was a piece of bread with cucumber and tomato when the rest of the cabin got a meat sandwich. There was no GF complementary snack. I appreciate the option of a GF meal. the quality was not there. I would rather pay for a better GF meal than have a poor one for free.
5397,I would have preferred a salad. I received three pieces of lettuce in a dixie cup with farro or some kind of legume. Why do not you proved lettuce as an option.
5398,The selection was somewhat limited considering it was a 5 hour flight.
5399,"Love the mini tea bottles, more variety like protein bars would be great."
5400,Would like my own bottle of water.
5401,My teenage son is very picky. Food is not appetizing for kids. Need mac-n-cheese and fries.
5402,I had none.
5403,1st class should have Champagne or French Sparkling wine. Please stop serving the horrible Prosecco.
5404,I did not receive any compliments food or drink.
5405,Was told before boarding they did not have food but appreciated the heads up and was given a voucher to get something before I boarded.
5406,"Dinner with better desert. Breakfast with bread/crissant, taking into consideration Brazilian breakfast culture."
5407,"No snacks served, only beverage."
5408,was not offered food or beverage in the second flight.
5409,We do not receive any food and/or beverages.
5410,"Payments with Credit cards should be allowed on board. As a foreigner, i had not installed the card on the app."
5411,"More diverse selection of complimentary food items would have been appreciated. I mean, for a nearly $800 round-trip ticket / airfare - I got to believe y'all could do better than just pretzels or cookies."
5412,More Vegan options please!. Thank you!.
5413,Offer at least 2 of the small pretzels.<😁>.
5414,Some of the snacks for purchase - the cheese platter - was not available on any of the 4 flights. It would be nice to have a few more healthy options to choose from.
5415,"on this flight the service was attentive, food choice was okay, it lacks a liuttle in presentation when compared to the best (emirates, qatar, singapore)."
5416,I do not eat carbs or sugar. Could you offer carrots/celery and a cheese square?. That would go over well. I think.
5417,Loved the Tai Chicken!.
5418,It would have been nice to have a bit more snack in first class.
5419,"Flight attendant took my order for a soda, gave me a napkin and cookie and forgot the soda."
5420,No.
5421,No.
5422,Could be better with some courtesy food and/beverages be served.
5423,All acceptable..
5424,Wine and beer were not stocked on this flight. no problem the service was great and flight attendant was friendly.
5425,"There needs to be more innovation and variety in the food. More choices of bread.’, a real and inviting ice cream sundae like American does with the static cart in the galley and made to order style, innovative salads with a real choice of dressing and hot mud flight snacks."
5426,No.
5427,There should be better food options available in First Class and Economy. The industry as a whole has lagged on that.
5428,"the plate of food offered was more or less a variety of snacks (cheese, yogurt, bread roll/butter, nuts, cookie). I was expecting an actual meal (entree, side, dessert)."
5429,"We used to get a snack, like nuts, but nothing on this flight."
5430,There was not enough drink.
5431,More options.
5432,None.
5433,The one meal was small. Yogurt and fruit.
5434,I was not offered a snack… pretzels?. I did receive them on the flight going.
5435,N/A.
5436,Very tasty!.
5437,The coffee on the return flight was not as good as usual. I like when you give a cookie or pretzel too.
5438,Would be nice to add hamburger to menu .
5439,No.
5440,"On one leg there was a southwestern salad, but not forks. Pretty hard to eat with my fingers."
5441,Paperless payment seemed a little clunky at this point.
5442,I miss getting a free snack of pretzels!. I had not flown in a couple years and was not aware we had to buy snacks.
5443,I appreciated the service with additional water bottles.
5444,"There appeared to be some problem with the mobile app and contactless payment. My credit card information was in the app, but the flight attendant could not access it and wound up charging me airline miles vs. paying with the credit card despite knowing that I wanted to pay with my credit card. Not sure where the issue was."
5445,"Offer the hamburger <🍔>, but have a separate package of tomato, onion, lettuce on the side. The hamburger was heated properly- needed at least tomato and lettuce. Also, mayonnaise package would be nice."
5446,There was a delay with food and beverages due to weather. nothing United could do. Flight attendants were great.
5447,Thank you!.
5448,better than expected.
5449,I would have likes a bag of pretzels.
5450,Salad was not appetizing and ice cold.
5451,I placed an online order which for some reason was not transmitted to flight attendant. She knew there was an order for me but it was blank. Not a big deal but odd regardless.
5452,Poor selection and the food had a terrible taste. Food quality was better pre-COVID.
5453,sparkling water instead of pomegranate water - and why not a light snack - you did that in the past. just a few pretzels is not a big deal.
5454,My wife and I were able to each have an entire can of juice.
5455,I would gladly pay for food if it [food] was tastefully prepared.
5456,I ordered a special meal and was pleasantly surprised how good it was !.
5457,"A second snack offering, or 2 units would have been great."
5458,na.
5459,Very good trip.
5460,Please provide pictures of food so customers have a better idea of what they are choosing to eat.
5461,More snack options.
5462,No.
5463,Ran out of pretzels and only had cookie available.
5464,No.
5465,no.
5466,"Breakfast was delicious but given Israel's requirement that all passengers must be seated 30 minutes before landing, I would serve the meal about 20 minutes earlier than it was served."
5467,"Quick flight only provided carbs. Protein would be excellent like nuts, or those Hormel nut/meat/cheese combos, yum."
5468,"Please add more food on board!. More choices = happier customer. Right now it is too limited. Snack boxes work but more variety, please."
5469,going to venice the food the like dog food.
5470,The portions and variety were not sufficient. Not even a bottle of water just a glass of water or juice. Not coffee. One small package of cookies for a whole 4 hrs flight.
5471,No beverage service offered on the flight.
5472,The breakfast crescent is served hot and is delicious. Using my mileage plus card for payment makes it very affordable.
5473,It would be nice to have an option for gluten free. I am celiac and could not eat any snack.
5474,It happens no Apple juice but it was a full flight.
5475,No.
5476,I was so nice that we were given a full can of soda. Seems like a small thing but I really appreciated it.
5477,no complimentary snacks offered only for purchase Why the change?.
5478,Flight was too short for any food or beverage.
5479,The snacks (pretzels and cookies) were fine. the meal (tiny piece of tofu over dry pasta) was tasteless and nearly inedible. There was a nice assortment of beverages although I drank only the water.
5480,Complimentary snacks were not offered on my other 3 flights last weekend.
5481,As per my previous note I think you really should provide menus beforehand so people can see what each food choice contains.
5482,Quite spare.
5483,Diet sprite should be added for another caffeine free soda.
5484,"Generally ok. Just a bit disappointed. Examples - salad comes as a pool of dressing with a heap of leaves bundled on the top - eventually found the dressing when I would poked around in the leaves long enough, Too late to do the mixing myself. Cheese for dessert - no biscuits. Compared to experiences of a few years ago, bit fast food diner than restaurant. However the price of my tickets seems to have rocketed."
5485,"The lunch which was served on the flight was very good. the pre-landing ""snack"" was an area which could use improvement. The two options which were offered we not up to standard."
5486,"The pre-arrival baked egg dish I selected was not great. The name was misleading, as it generally was a rehash of standard breakfast components I have seen served as egg dish. I thought it would be something different and an improvement."
5487,no.
5488,"in First Class, nothing was served during the last 4 hours of the 5 hour flight. we used to get a freshly baked cookie."
5489,no.
5490,It was Good.
5491,Beverage was coffee and water!. Coffee was good!.
5492,Why not offer many snack choices since we pick from a tray ourselves?. No extra effort or time would be required.
5493,It was nice to be offered a drink and cookie.
5494,They only served pretzels. I enjoy the biscoff or the stropwaffles.
5495,Ran out of apple juice.
5496,food options could be improved.
5497,I answered incorrectly for this leg of the trip. there was no meal for this flight.
5498,The pancake meal was delicious.
5499,Stewardess seemed too busy to give proper attention to our request.
5500,was available.
5501,You should offer to purchase 2 drinks at a time instead of 1.
5502,No snacks were served.
5503,"I like having a choice of snack, even if it is only two choices."
5504,I selected that issue by mistake because my issue was from San Francisco to Portland and not coming home. On the trip up there were no snacks offered and I have come to expect cookies or pretzels.
5505,I would suggest at least two white wine options.
5506,n/a.
5507,"Our first class experience was an improvement over past trips. we were able to get a preflight beverage (coffee w Baileys), not just water."
5508,Dinner seved was all veg. Should include Non Veg dinner also.
5509,Menu does not match with the food given.
5510,Can not order food on the app if you do not have the app. Can not get the app if you do not have wifi. Can not use wifi if you do not have the app. It is a catch-22. Did not get the app before you board?. No food for you.
5511,I would stop handing out brezels or biscotti on the flights (except for children maybe). This produces a lot of garbage. the nutritional value is minimal. These snacks are also not healthy. Thank you for listening!.
5512,Less plastic and half and half for coffee would be great.
5513,For a short flight the service in first class was very good and the snack options were excellent.
5514,Not at the time.
5515,Been trying to think of something besides them cookies to serve. Everything is either salty or sweet. No ideas.
5516,"The flight attendant by past me with the second round of water. I was sitting next to an extremely large man. she served him and did not even ask me if I wanted any water. Also, the beverage cart only came through one time. I would have liked a club soda."
5517,Taste could be improved.
5518,varieties.
5519,It was ok.
5520,It is ok.
5521,I wanted the cheeseburger. you were still serving breakfast.
5522,"the starter was unappetising. I tried it and found it as unappetising as it looked. The main course of pasta and tomato sauce could have been warmer, and the ice cream desert had largely melted by the time I got round to eating it."
5523,Just want a little mote flavor.
5524,Good service.
5525,Nah!.
5526,Next time get straws.
5527,was not able to purchase snack in time for flight.
5528,No.
5529,More coffee.
5530,Dr Pepper.
5531,Would have liked some snack.
5532,There was too much dressing for the salad. The salad greens were bitter. My son had the burger and said it was o.k. but not great.
5533,It is very difficult to eat on the smallish tray provided while holding a glass during turbulences. It is impossible to cut meat and hold a glass.
5534,need add like potato chips. also need to add beverage like V8.
5535,The pork served as barbecue was not a good choice for airline food. Dryed out and awful with a drop of sauce.
5536,They only option on this flight was water. I did like a snack selection.
5537,no.
5538,The chicken pesto was decent but not great. The side salad was too cold. The dessert egg custard tart was good enough but too cold.
5539,The snack tray is not that good.
5540,Did not realize that the pre-selection was not charged unless I requested from Flight Attendant.
5541,Should change up the menu. Always the same options flying over and back...kind of getting bored of beef spare ribs and chicken katsu...even if they are good. I really do not like the salad or dressing and it is the same each time so it gets thrown in the bin.
5542,No. All pretty good.
5543,The food was extremely salty which although the portion size was good the extreme use of salt may it inedible. I was barely able to consume 1/4 of the serving. And my husband was also unable to consume it.
5544,Service was not offered because the flight was a bit bumpy. Flight was short so not a problem.
5545,N/A.
5546,"Yes, on 3 flights my husband asked for one of each snack, as did other passengers, and these were provided. On the last flight he asked for one of each and was told he could not have both as they might not have enough for all passengers- most were sleeping anyway."
5547,Missed the snack.
5548,No.
5549,"I often do not find a meal I can eat in business class so try to eat before I travel. The business meals can be nice but sometimes too complex for simple eaters with GI challenges. Prefer a more simple chicken breast to eg a spicy Indian chicken dish and would be nice if both could be available. The lounges are variable with some having great food and others not much to offer. Overall, not a major issue with the food and quality I am business is always high."
5550,When I was offered the chicken as an option the attendant did not say it was curry chicken. The meal was fine just not my favorite.
5551,The vegetarian lunch was good .. we had the sandwich later which was not enjoyable.. it was oily because the cheese had melted as it was served hot which made it stick to the wrapping..
5552,We were offered a beverage. no snacks available in first class.
5553,I wish there had been more than two choices. I was happy with my selection.
5554,Chicken was too spicy.
5555,would have like additional beverage service.
5556,"The food to and from Guam has been the same for awhile now, especially the breakfast from Guam to HNL, I believe it has been the same for over a decade?!?."
5557,no.
5558,Keep Coke Zero Sugar!.
5559,Only beverages.
5560,Better variety with the snack box.
5561,They have no chicken left. I had to get something else.
5562,L carne de vacuno que me sirvieron tenía muy buen sabor pero estaba un poco dura y grasienta.
5563,"All other were 100% good, but the food and sallad is a bit un the low side, no dressing for the sallad.. Dry bread.. Breakfast or snacks, on the morning after long flight maybee sweets are not the preferred to eat especially when travelling with athletes."
5564,It was great!.
5565,"Food items may only be purchased through an ""app."". We do not own a cell phone. purchasing food was not an option. This could cause great difficulties for us as my husband is an insulin-dependent diabetic. If we had not had the forethought to have brought food on board with us, he might have had a sugar crash and required IMMEDIATE medical attention while on the flight."
5566,"The snack was a ""cheese tray"" snack - it was awesome - way better than any snack I have ever had on a flight."
5567,No.
5568,"Just so so. Add more healthy options, including stuff without carbs."
5569,"This was a huge improvement from the past. Delighted to have a choice given in advance, presentation portions and taste very good. Appreciated the fruit and warm dessert, too. thank you."
5570,Step up the snacks on long flights.
5571,Flight attendant very accomodating.
5572,Need better snacks and maybe a mint when we land?.
5573,Pleased with the multiple vegetarian options for preorder. Falafel bowl was tasty. presentation was messy and unappealing.
5574,Our meal we ordered was not delivered to the flight. The flight crew provided an excellent alternative. We just removed the chicken.
5575,No more pretzels.
5576,N/A.
5577,Flight sfo to lax - no food or drink.
5578,Water should be offered throughout the flight on international flights.
5579,No.
5580,I could not use the app to pay. Why can not you accept cash?. I would have purchased more. On the out bound flight we received no snack. On the return flight we did not get a choice of snack. the biscuits were good.
5581,"I appreciated getting the entire can of Coke. We were given no choice in free snack, only pretzels were offerred."
5582,I suppose the food I received was called a snack tray rather than a meal. I may have missed the wrong response.
5583,Thank you.
5584,I just like to see another meal instead of the sandwich.
5585,"It appears that things have changed in Business Class. It was always nice to receive first the warm nuts and beverage, followed by an appetizer, then main and dessert. After that, there were chocolates and cordials. It was ice that the meal was stretched out a bit, especially on a long flight. No longer an appetizer and after dessert amenities. Dessert was offered. I chose not to have it."
5586,The pretzels were old. the ice gave the Diet Coke a weird taste.
5587,There is plenty of food and beverage variety. I have flown several times in the past month with UA. the same meals are served.
5588,We were on a five and a half hour flight and they only came through with the drink cart once and the snacks.
5589,No average meal. Service was excellent.
5590,More than cookies or Pretzels.
5591,Good selection in business class.
5592,Sandwiches.
5593,Better coffee.
5594,The food was very basic. I would like to see more green veggies as well.
5595,I would have liked a a lettuce salad as part of the dinner rather than noodles. And breakfast sausage was a bit spicy - would have preferred a quiche.
5596,You did not serve nut mix or snack with beverages before dinner was served.
5597,No option available for food. Only vegetarian and not something I like. Other people like me return it and not consumed.
5598,No. I understand I have to give up great snacks for an acceptable purchase price.
5599,When flying in economy plus. i would like to see liquor options offered for free.
5600,2nd offering of snacks would have been nice lime Southwest does.
5601,More coffee.
5602,A bit pricey.
5603,Need a snack.
5604,Need to restore pre-pandemic Polaris service to be competitive.
5605,Strange choices for breakfast…chicken sausage or ricotta pancakes ….
5606,The burger was too hot. It [burger] should not be served in those porcelain trays because they get too hot.
5607,More beer options. A snack would have been nice.
5608,Would have liked fruit snacks or a protein bar.
5609,The pretzel roll was delicious.
5610,Please offer a more diverse beer selection. !!.
5611,"as noted before - two recent meals I have had on UA international flights were the worst meals I have ever had on an airline. i realize you economize on everything in economy, but honestly you should do better!."
5612,Thanks for supporting Vets - Anthem. $10 for Baileys seems a bit high. I think I had the Takeoff box - good.
5613,"I just wish that dinner is serve for free just like it used to be, that is all!."
5614,The breakfast was very little and the food too. I do not consume dairy.
5615,"Breakfast menu could be improved. Simple egg, cereal, yogurt, fruit & roll. I choose pancakes which were too heavy & sweet. I did eat the yogurt & fruit which was also on the tray."
5616,"The wine (chardonnay) was probably the worst I have ever tasted. I had asked for bubbles. there was no Champagne nor prosecco or franciacorta. My food selection was vegetarian, not vegan. yet I was not given the eggs breakfast option. At lunch I was given, besides the rest of the food, a yoghurt (?). that is more appropriate for a breakfast. The mango sorbet was pleasant."
5617,No.
5618,"It would be nice to serve better wines. They were ok, but not of the quality of other carriers."
5619,"I was only offered water once on the flight. I wanted some coffee before landing (about an hour) but the flight attendant only asked the row ahead of me, and never asked me. The flight was almost 4 hours so she should have offered. come by at least a few times. Not sure why that happened but I finally gave up waiting."
5620,muy bien todo.
5621,More variety.
5622,Our only comment on the food is that to us this morning flight seems due for a menu refresh.
5623,I think that in 1st class there should at least be some kind of bread offered with a breakfast menu.
5624,no.
5625,Taste of chicken not good too limon pls change.
5626,Good should be provided on a longer flight.
5627,Delicious!.
5628,none.
5629,The quality of the food went down vs what was proposed before the pandemic. Many other companies offer now better food experience than United.
5630,A bottle of water would have been a good idea.
5631,Ran out of nuts and did not get any. Seemed they were also short on entrees but i got what i wanted.
5632,no.
5633,No food was offered.
5634,Just make bigger portions.
5635,Everything is good.
5636,The meal tasted better than I expected.
5637,It was excellent!!!.
5638,Sparkling water.
5639,too much ice put in the cups which means you barely get any decent volume of the beverage itself need to give at least TWO bags of those tiny-sized snacks.
5640,beer selection was not very good.
5641,"First class food just is not as good as what i get on Delta, seems too ""instant"" and packaged."
5642,The food was not good.
5643,"Yes, honestly, it was unexpectedly good!. It was so much better then I remembered."
5644,White wine has gone off in big bottles - and for premium we felt we could be offered a small glass of champagne.
5645,She gave me the whole can!.
5646,Transparency accuracy take care of your consumers.
5647,I want to be able to pre order within 24 hours not 4days in advance.
5648,"I definitely got food poisoning. Let me explain the ‘neutral’ rating for an experience that was very truly a dissatisfying experience. I was shocked at the shift in food offerings and beverages. United is very clearly trying super hard to understand and better-serve customers. That is obviously outstanding. Food poisoning was an offset to the experience, as I am sure you can appreciate."
5649,Water was my option as Tea was not provided with Hot Water and bag of tea.
5650,1 very small pre-wrapped cookie did not do much for snack. for 1st class I think the food should have been so much better. seemed very stingy!.
5651,I think a can of Sprite instead of a bitty glass would be appropriate.
5652,"Cookies, wine."
5653,Why do I have to choose between snacks. Why not offering both or a variety of others?.
5654,Snack bar as in CRJ-550 would be better.
5655,Please cease serving yogurt on long flights. People in my cabin got gas and farted throughout the flight. It was smelly. The food choices were mediocre compared to Delta. That is my main complaint.
5656,"more options on 2 hour flights, would be nice."
5657,No snack offered on the return flight.
5658,You need to offer water more than once on a 6 hour flight. It was hard to get anyone's attention.
5659,"No, nothing wrong I just opted out."
5660,No Apple juice.
5661,"Unlike our flight UA 300 Saturday Sept. 10, 2022 the food was very good."
5662,Please update snack options to purchase and spirit selection. Add tequila!.
5663,They only offered me water no food ( snack ).
5664,We read on the website that alcohol was to be offered free but it was not.
5665,Nothing was offered on the flight.
5666,Asking me to rate food & beverage in the first half of the survey is a joke is not it?. Rate 2 biscuits and a handful of pretzels?. Get serious.
5667,"We also had the takeoff snack box, and it was the best for the price I have had on any airline."
5668,Should have more of a variety to choose from (snacks) and should be offered twice.
5669,Nothing was offered.
5670,No.
5671,More choices.
5672,I was in Business Class. I would like to see the food service go back to the way it was before COVID.
5673,I was surprised that we received a snack sandwich and beverage service toward the end of the flight. The sandwich was good and served at the right temperature. Turned out that it was nice to have since I had two more flights to take to my final destination and got home late.
5674,No one offered coffee to my wife.
5675,I was never asked if I would like coffee or not.
5676,No.
5677,"Again, as in May we were offered water on one occasion apart from the drink service. It is difficult to keep asking the passenger next to you to let you out because you want some water. Other airlines offer water on boarding & twice during the flight."
5678,The burger was served extremely hot and I had to wait a while just to pick it [burger] up to eat. It took over ten minutes and it still did not cool down completely.
5679,no.
5680,n/a.
5681,I really miss Honey roasted peanuts!.
5682,Not enough healthy selections.
5683,"Beverages were only offered at the beginning of the flight and at the end. Granted, it was likely not to disturb sleeping patrons however, for a 9 hour flight, there should have been more."
5684,"The food was not wonderful, but it was vastly improved since the last time I flew."
5685,The waffle with berries was fantastic!.
5686,My wife has diabetes. she did not receive a meal to accommodate her.
5687,An alternative vegetarian meal would have been nice . I am not a fan of pasta .
5688,I struggled to order these from the website. I could see what was available on-line. I could not order them.
5689,I did not realize food had to be ordered before boarding. I liked it better when you could order in flight with a credit card.
5690,I was glad to see a vegetarian meatball option.
5691,for first class need a little better options.
5692,I would of liked a can instead of just a sippy cup.
5693,"Their should be a third food option. The waffle is overly sweet. the eggs and ham does not work for vegans or kosher diets. The beverages offered to me in first class were only water, coffee, and orange juice. No other beverages offered."
5694,None.
5695,Tasted better than it usually had in the past.
5696,The dessert was inedible. The dinner tray and drinks were slow to come. The tray had a bowl of nuts on it which I would have served either with the boarding sparkling wine or shortly after take off with the cocktails. Other than that…it was good.
5697,Cranberry Juice.
5698,Very little room on tray tables when served.
5699,What I am shocked about is how meals are no longer served and we either have to bring our own our pay high prices for mediocre food. How about you just continue to offer free drinks and stop hawking food/alcoholic beverages on the flights?.
5700,"A meal was served, and it was quite good (I chose tortellini), and served hot, and I had a selection of wines to choose from -- that was nice!. Where I think my reaction was not so positive was the snack served just prior to landing, which was some kind of turkey crostini, and I thought it was flavorless and the amt of turkey was meager."
5701,A little more snack variety.
5702,Tea and coffee was milky and tasteless Hard to get the attention of a flight attendant during meal service Robotic experience.
5703,"I think there should also be Sprite Zero. also known as diet sprite. We need something no caffeine but also no calories, besides water."
5704,The meal I was served was tasty. The only issue was they did not have the meal that I had preordered.
5705,No.
5706,I expected to see other items offered to buy.
5707,"No, but should be more options for Snack."
5708,I liked the vegetarian option for a meal.
5709,Nothing to note.
5710,It was fine.
5711,Was in first class and all that was offered is pretzels and waffle cookie.
5712,"I just feel upset about the dysfunctional meal tray, drink spillage, and dirty bathroom."
5713,"The flight was so short that there was no service- if that is the case, suggest you set that as the expectation so we can have coffee before boarding!."
5714,wine selection very satisfactory.
5715,I had a cookie that was delicious. It was only offered on one of the flights. I wish I had it on the others. Really good.
5716,"It was not offered on the short flight up to Boston, but was in the way back. No snacks offered though."
5717,Could provide a snack.
5718,Oh I thought you were taking about my flight from Rome to Newark….
5719,There seems to be no differentiation in snacks between first class and coach on short domestic flights. this is one area for potential improvement.
5720,"I wine list would be appreciated in stead having to ""ask"" for it."
5721,"I love the cookies, but can we get a non pretzel option for the salty snacks?."
5722,A free snack option like the typical biscuits or stroupwaffle would have been nice.
5723,I could not bring up my icon on United to purchase drinks or snacks.
5724,They give us our snack. out drinking comes 25 minutes later. Just do them together.
5725,No beverages offer.
5726,ONLY ONE NUMBER BEVERAGE SERVED.
5727,"Already mentioned earlier, ended up getting vegetarian option as that was all that was left by the time our turn came."
5728,Would be great to have water before we landed.
5729,n/a.
5730,None.
5731,Water should be offered but not out of a community bottle.
5732,The Food Service was very weak. I know that additional snacks were offered for a cost. I flew Southwest Airlines from CA to HI. they provided an Upgraded Snack Package at no charge for the long flight. United did not. Southwest Wins.
5733,"Traveling is tuff right now with delays, it would be nice to have sandwiches, a salad ect."
5734,.
5735,Vegetarian lunch was some melted cheese on a roll. Not very appetizing.
5736,It is a long 10 hour flight. no meal was serve just snacks.
5737,NO.
5738,I think offering dinner at 11 in the night on this flight is not a great idea. Most people eat dinner between 6-8 pm. Probably best to give a small snack and then a good breakfast in am. Offer of fruit and yougurt at breakfast was good.
5739,I was very happy to see that snack boxes were available for purchase. Other airlines have the available on the same segment.
5740,I appreciated the orange soda water with zero sugar as I am on a keto diet.
5741,I covered this in my earlier comments.
5742,"I wanted tonic water <💧> <😕> We had registered as vegetarian. food portion was very small. My partner got ice cream. I did not. I understand that they are busy. But to leave the dessert out, is not gone unnoticed. However, I do appreciate them coming around several times to offer water <💧> as it is essential to stay hydrated."
5743,"loved no ice, and especially for ME: cranberry juice, and for both my husband and me: Decaf coffee. Also I like the table and area wipes (my husband does not bother."
5744,Water is dispensed in very small cups which seemed very wasteful for a 12 hour flight. A bottle of water should be handed out instead. The plastic cups are very wasteful and bad for the environment. Maybe paper cups or something biodegradable would be better. Not enough water is given for the length of flight. Cans of soda were offered which was nice. The first United flight we took from SFO to Frankfurt did not offer cans of soda. Just small cups at a time.
5745,I do prefer the more elegant setting and food service on Swiss.
5746,"Soft drinks should be served as a whole 12 Oz can. Also, no pretzels?."
5747,"The hamburger was just ordinary, nothing special. Had to ask for more ketchup. Would have liked BBQ sauce instead. NO FRIES!!!!."
5748,Thanks for the nuts - a tradition. Chicken was tastly but very small portion. Cheesecake in saran wrap is taky.
5749,"I would just like to share that your selection of vegan options is not good. With more individuals choosing vegetarian and vegan, especially in first class, the selection is not good."
5750,"It was a surprise having food served. I stuffed a Burger King chesseburger down before and wish I would have known there would be a meal served. I always get emails about wifi and entertainment. prior to flying, however do not recall any mention of a meal."
5751,No.
5752,More than one vegetarian/pescatarian option would be good.
5753,In general food provided across the airline industry is poor to terrible. The food we had on this flight was good. My wife and I commented to each other about the taste and quality.
5754,Offered cookies on flight up but not back. Was told not offered on flights below a certain number of miles.
5755,We preordered food and drinks for both flights however on our first flight the system was down and they could not provide the snacks we ordered. On the way back they did not have the snack available anymore we got cookies and almonds instead. If you found on a meal on your flight and you do not get what you preordered it is very disappointing!.
5756,United provided snacks free of charge at the gate as the restaurants were closed at SFO. This helped so many of us especially those making a connecting flight. We would have been stuck without anything.
5757,None at this time.
5758,"I noticed that for a few passengers that nearly missed the connecting flight and had to RUN to catch the plane, the attendant offered them water immediately because they were clearly out of breath. That was very nice of her."
5759,I appreciated that I was able to get the whole can.
5760,I was pleased to receive snacks and a dinner on the flight.
5761,"i was surprised to receive the entire can of juice, that was nice."
5762,No.
5763,No Gluten Free choices.
5764,No choice big snacks. No meal.
5765,Same selection as flight to Florida.
5766,There was no snack offered.
5767,Did not have time to get food at the airport due to security taking so long. Would have liked another snack option for our flight.
5768,I choose the beef is good. But the side dish soba was not good.
5769,A few more options perhaps. Seeing the same 3 to 4 choices on all my flights.
5770,We did not have any.
5771,Loved that there was a white wine that was not Chardonnay. Yay Pinot Grigio!.
5772,No.
5773,ran out of cheese tray and a couple passengers were not happy about that.
5774,"The ""lunch"" served at the end of the flight - a warm ham-and-cheese roll - was very pleasant, more so than trying to eat with a fork and knife."
5775,more cookies.
5776,No.
5777,Snacks are too small and not very good.
5778,I preordered. my preorder was changed.
5779,"I had the chicken on my flight…. it was cold, which I do not like…the size of the chicken was large and the plastic fork did not cut the cold chicken….. The salad did not have dressing and was bland. the dessert was good."
5780,The chicken was cold and hard.
5781,The food options listed on the app were different than what we received onboard. There should more more options to choose.
5782,I think something more than pretzels and cookies could be offered to economy plus - a granola bar or something.
5783,"I was upgraded to first class so had a cheese tray snack, not pretzels."
5784,Just on timing they gave me a whole soda but no time to consume product <:/>.
5785,Tequila would be nice.
5786,Need healthier snacks <;)> maybe nuts?. Granola ?.
5787,"The flight attendants were not aware that the vegetarian meal required heating, so it was cold and unpleasant."
5788,Charge me $20 more on my ticket and provide snack box and wifi entertainment for free.
5789,Ran out of my first choice meal the hamburger before arrival. Ended up with a vegetable plate with couscous. Would have preferred a chicken dish.
5790,I was upgraded to first and enjoyed the cheese tray and almonds. The food was excellent especially for a short trip.
5791,No.
5792,N/A.
5793,Sandwich was terrible.
5794,"good experience, will fly united again."
5795,Nope.
5796,Appreciate the snacks.
5797,"Boring , need to change it [need] up."
5798,Could have both snacks. Pretzels and cookie.
5799,It would be good to have packets of nuts available without having to get the entire snack box. Wasteful.
5800,No.
5801,Thank you for the very nice chicken and rice hot meal. I really enjoyed it.
5802,did not have a choice in premium economy which seems surprising as there are only a few seats and it was not full.
5803,"Short flight, no food/beverage service, could at least hand out small bottles of water."
5804,"I like the standard menu United offers drink wise, but it would be nice to see some Regional Beers on their respective flights. Wisconsin and Illinois both have great breweries for example."
5805,No thanks.
5806,"No wine selection menu, offered only by color. Pre poured champagne prior to takeoff was flat."
5807,Excellent lunch One of the best I have had on UA.
5808,No.
5809,variety is poor - the same meal (chicken and meatball) options every flight.
5810,Wou.
5811,Food has vastly improved!.
5812,the kosher food from usa to Israel is excellent. from Israel to usa not so good.
5813,nothing- great!.
5814,No.
5815,Took a long time to get beverages. Just wanted ice as I already had water. Took about 2 hours in before they served anything.
5816,The meals in buisness are poor. It is not like before the covid19.
5817,Pkease !!. You mUST start to offer plant based milk for coffee!!!!.
5818,"In business, something more than a box would be wonderful."
5819,"Asparagus was atrocious. Tough, not tasty at all. Small muffin/cookie for dessert was insufficient. Need more milk, only had one glass and wanted more."
5820,The dinner meal was good. The pre landing meal was not good. The quiche was dried out and tasteless. It also was the only option.
5821,When booking the flight I chose a vegan meal option. there was not one available and not on the list of special meals. My flight attendant Randy got me every available vegan snack and was extremely apologetic and very sweet.
5822,The coffee was not so hot.
5823,Very clean fresh coffee.
5824,"Prefer Remy Martin VSOP Congac, American and United stopped carrying Congac."
5825,Not much selection but they did have Bloody Mary mix.
5826,Love that you have added champagne to domestic first class.
5827,Decaf coffee is instant coffee I have to mix myself. Not cool.
5828,No snacks were provided from SFO to ORD.
5829,Need a larger selection of wines.
5830,bigger cup of coffee.
5831,Offer additional drinks on long flights. We were offered one drink.
5832,I wish stroopwaffle were available on more flights!.
5833,I found it extremely frustrating to have to load my info and get the app just to purchase beverages. I did not buy anything and probably will not on future flights.
5834,"It seems very little to ask, and a generous gesture to offer a little something on a flight. In the absence of a light snack and drink, I will always bring my own."
5835,Nothing much.. Everything was upto the mark!!!.
5836,Return the meal service especially in longer flights.
5837,Lighter fare would be a good option.
5838,"Appreciate the ability to preorder. However, had to ask the attendant for our preordered boxes. Would have been nice if they brought them automatically when the food service started."
5839,I would like different kind of food.
5840,The food options were much better on the return trip. not everything was available. The spirits and coffee were fantastic and brewed fresh nearly every time I requested a cup.
5841,More snack options.
5842,No.
5843,Most people bring their own things. I suggest offering high quality products for sale only.
5844,The food tasted great. Not a wide variety of options presented for dinner and no options were presented for dessert.
5845,No snack was offered.
5846,I forgot to get the credit card for the flight. the snacks is not good enough to sustain The five hour flight.
5847,N/a.
5848,more sparkling water options or maybe an Ice Coffee option for purchase?.
5849,Just would like a little more selection of the snacks and maybe a little bit bigger portion.
5850,"On all of my recent flights that I have gone first class, it seems like the food options are always the same. It is either chicken or impossible meatball. I do not think either are very good and it would be nice if there were different options based on different flights."
5851,The hamburger bun was dry and crumbly!.
5852,"Two things: the food was not advertised as an amenity in First Class on the app, so we ate ahead of time - alas. Second, the chicken entree was not available. even though there were only 12 of us in First Class. Seems a miss. Thanks."
5853,Glad to see I could get Bloody Mary Mix on board for my beverage choice.
5854,If possible more options on sodas.
5855,No.
5856,It is always the same cookies which Become quite boring after a few fights.
5857,The meal was probably the best tasting meal that I have ever had on a plane. It surprised me in that it was excellent.
5858,You should be able to purchase food and beverage without pre-registering your credit card!.
5859,I never received the coffee I asked for.
5860,It was a duplicate menu to the Cincinnati to Denver menu. Actually had snack box on this flight.
5861,The meal option was identical to the Cincinnati to Denver segment. Therefore snack box on this flight.
5862,A little snack or something would have been nice.
5863,"I was very happy to get an inflight meal, was not expecting it based on past experiences. The thing that I noticed that might be improved was salad dressing for the salad. It did not taste like there was any on the salad, that is all. Meals were a very unexpected delight. Thank you."
5864,"They used to give out drink tickets you can use on your flights, you should bring those back."
5865,The flight attendant forgot to give me a meal like my seat neighbors. I do not know why. I had to ask several times to be served.
5866,More options.
5867,Would like to see a better quality cabernet among the offerings.
5868,It would be nice to offer nuts of some kind.
5869,Having vegetarian/vegan options is a huge step up and MUCH APPRECIATED!!.
5870,See initial response. The idea of first class should not be waiting until you get in the air and level and then offered something. No water or anything. The attendant made me feel like he was a retired professor and I was getting yelled at. He came up to my chair at one point and pressed the button to recline me with zero notice. Very rude.
5871,Not on this flight.
5872,It was a quick flight so there was no food or beverage service.
5873,Food options were limited. Food quality was average.
5874,A snack would have been nice: pretzels or chips or nuts.
5875,"During the flights back home, multiple United planes were out of hot food."
5876,couple of things: it should not be up to me to remember my pre-selection;. there was no choice as choice was for frequent flyers.
5877,"If a customer likes a seltzer plus cranberry, I think both cans should be given. I make my own spritz and want/need the 24oz of fluid. Especially because the second round of drinks was just the cup worth. It is a long flight."
5878,Have not got it.
5879,It was great to be able to choose. enjoy!.
5880,no free snacks like a bag of pretzels or peanuts?.
5881,A snack would be nice.
5882,"Same old same old--United needs to up their game with what is offered for lunch/dinner in the first class cabin. Same choices for so long now, and not very good. Again, better experience with American."
5883,"I ordered coffee, which was really good."
5884,Just the fact the pilot was the best I have ever had.
5885,Change the snack box every 6months as it gets old for road warriors. 1K members should get more than 1 complimentary adult beverages.
5886,No.
5887,Cheese tray or chicken bowl.
5888,No snacks were served.
5889,"No, but the food on my flight to London was amazing!."
5890,Vegetarian lunch/Pasta was very bad. You may consider other options or better chefs.
5891,There was no juice selection. Really?!. Not even a snack?!.
5892,I was in first class. I was napping when the snacks were distributed. I was not offered a makeup snack when I woke up. Also it seems like this flight was long enough for something other than a snack.
5893,The meal was “ok”. I remember when United meals were tastier.
5894,"I had not flown in several years and was surprised to find inflight meals had to be purchased. Why the change?. Also, to purchase anything on the plane the United app had to be used. Yes, convenient but perhaps not everyone has a smartphone."
5895,There was no service on this flight. Too short.
5896,Wine was sub par for the usual basic red wine served.
5897,Beverages were served a little late.
5898,Offer more frequently.
5899,No.
5900,Prices.
5901,I had my own water and snacks.
5902,It was exceptional.
5903,Request for vegan food to UAL was ign.
5904,There were no Swoopwaffles offered. Snacks were extremely limited and very small.
5905,Breakfast amount was precarious. Dinner excellent.
5906,I really appreciate the effort made to provide a tasty gluten-free meal.
5907,"The dessert was a custard tart and it was incredible!. Like someone french had prepared it [dessert]!!!. HOWEVER.. the BREAKFAST WAS HORRIBLE. It was the eggs with sausages that had hard inedible things in it. so I stopped eating after 2 bites of the sausage. And there was some bready thing on the plate with a tomatoey concoction on top of it... disgusting actually. The teeny croissant was worse than any croissant could be. So, in contrast to the chicken with the incredibly tasty sauce, the breakfast was abhorrent. Too bad, because I had no opportunity to eat after breakfast for quite some time."
5908,The taste could be improved.
5909,Please provide gluten free options.
5910,no.
5911,Everything was just right!.
5912,Should have better quality of food...
5913,"a small bag of pretzels would have been appreciated, especially since I sat in row 7 and first class got all the snacks they wanted and were offered several times."
5914,Top notch service.
5915,Would be great if the service included a small snack offering even if it is just a cracker or cookie.
5916,I was given a caramel waffle as a snack. It was tasty!.
5917,White wine was nasty. Not very good. Fruit place was supposed to have a chocolate candy but did not. Pictured showed it with candy.
5918,I like the addition of the AHA sparkling water.
5919,It would have been nice to have a small snack. Such as pretzels.
5920,"The “pre-arrival snack” in business class was awesome!. Cheeseburger, fruit, and a brownie. Simple and tasty!. We do not need quinoa or couscous…. just real/normal food like this. Very nice."
5921,"Yes like a Premier 1K, the flight attendents did not offer me mi complementary food and beverage."
5922,N/A.
5923,Should be able to get at least two varieties.
5924,It was a bit confusing about ordering in the flight vs online beforehand.
5925,"Yes, enjoyed the pre-flight drink of mimosa."
5926,No.
5927,All good.
5928,They did not offer any beverages. there was no turbulence. Awful as we had been delayed over an hour.
5929,Bad food.
5930,I had asked for pretzels or a snack. the flight attendant told only certain things are available for purchase and walked away.
5931,Flight attendant asked me if I wanted another when she saw I was empty. That is service!!.
5932,I really wish Mai Tai's were boarded for flights to Hawaii. That used to be a great part of the experience. Wish there were more options geared towards providing a Hawaiian style experience.
5933,"I tried to select my meal online, 5 days before the flight and just 30 minutes after I received the email notice about advance selection. It said that everything other than the vegetarian option were no longer available. That makes no sense at all. So as a business class flyer, I had to buy a sandwich at the airport to carry aboard. That just am not right."
5934,"Often, there was no choice to pick from for the passengers seated in the back seats of the plane."
5935,Only offered water.
5936,I like the flavored seltzer water choices.
5937,Need more food on UA 1 & UA 2 flights… two meals and one snack is highly inadequate for a 15hr+ flight.
5938,Breakfast was offered on the 8:00 AM flight and both choices offered were great.
5939,NO.
5940,quality could be better of the meal.
5941,Should have better food service for such a long flight.
5942,Tasted great. Best airline food I have had in a long time.
5943,Our meal was not that great. Too cold.
5944,The tomato did not look good.
5945,Todo bien.
5946,No.
5947,"The tea is brewed in pots that have previously been used for coffee and you can clearly taste it - in a word, gross."
5948,"They served the meal right away, so we could sleep (it was a redeye flight)."
5949,please bring back tito's vodka and illy coffee... the coffee is horrible now and the vodka cheap !!. you can do better !. thank you.
5950,Same snacks all the time. I flew May July August and Sept and same snacks.
5951,"I would think on a long flight of 5 hours or more, United would provide a FREE meal. We flew from Venice to Newark on United and received a FREE dinner and FREE sandwich & snack. So, why on our flight from Newark to Los Angles, we only got a wafer?."
5952,No food or beverage service. It would be nice to be offered little water bottles at least.
5953,"WiFi was not letting anyone use CC on file. Forced to use miles, which I would rather not have done."
5954,N/A.
5955,The purchase option especially for vegetarians like me is almost non-existent.
5956,"the food choice was limited to chicken and vegi meatballs, so not really a choice. The chicken dish was ok, however, it was a repeat dish from my flight earlier in the week, so sad to have the same meal again. Fruit was ok, but would have preferred a salad. Dessert was the warm cookie/muffin thing, while it tasted good, also very small."
5957,"Hot chocolate and other brands of beer, only one was available that was a light beer. I wish I could have more food on board."
5958,None provided.
5959,Who no beverages served before take off?.
5960,No.
5961,I enjoyed the complimentary Stella beer.
5962,All was great.
5963,"On my business class flight to boston, i did not receive a snack, even though I requested one."
5964,Please change your offerings more often. I have not flown in 6 months and still the options were the same.
5965,Flight was not long enough.
5966,I was surprised that on a long haul business class product there was no wine list printed on the menu. It really enhances the experience when you provide a description of tasting notes and origin and wineries the wine comes from. It is not helpful when you ask a flight attendant about the wines onboard and they know nothing about them. All they know is “red or white?”. And when you ask about a white option all the can say is “I think one is a Chardonnay and one is a Sauvignon”.
5967,None consumed. No problem.
5968,"The tea is always too strong, dark color, not fresh."
5969,It would be good to have more availability of choices. my first choice of entree was not available for some reason.
5970,Flight attendants were spot on!. Fantastic service!.
5971,Ok.
5972,Great breakfast considering the other choices.
5973,"Instead of offering water or champagne prior to flight, I would prefer beer."
5974,Food choices in business class was not optimal. Frankly my wife nor I really enjoyed the meal.
5975,It is a short flight...cookies work fine.
5976,On such a long flight I would think another round of beverages would be appropriate.
5977,more vegan snack options.
5978,There was no hot food available on our flight. I did not not find out until we had boarded. The food was inedible. was not enough quantity in comparison to a hot meal. The offering of drinks is great. The white wine is terrible.
5979,Would suggest more options.
5980,It would be nice if you would have some peanuts or pretzels or Biscotti.
5981,"There were no complimentary snacks offered on this flight. Usually at least cookies or pretzels would be provided. Only snacks for sale. Regarding beverages, on both American and Delta, passengers in Comfort Plus are provided with complimentary alcoholic beverages - this would be a nice change for United and would make it on par with the other 2 major carriers."
5982,"""Impossible meatballs"" option is actually one of the best I have had on the short haul (USA internal) flights in recent years."
5983,The snack could have come a bit earlier.
5984,The other kinds of cookies I wanted.
5985,It is a long flight. could have had better snacks.
5986,Wanted to Suggest - Maybe some snack could have been given ... Being an early morning flight also the stalls at the airport were closed.
5987,the meals were excellent.
5988,the option of sweet and salty was a nice touch.
5989,The options available to purchase in advance were very limited. I bought a sandwich and apple in the terminal.
5990,"In past a wafer or cookie were offered with a beverage. That was not the case, and when I asked, was told they were not served any longer."
5991,No thanks.
5992,"I wish all airlines would offer a small meal of some sort. Back in the day, if you were on a early flight. you would get breakfast food and afternoon flight, would be a sandwich and chips."
5993,Breakfast Belgian waffles good.
5994,no snacks.
5995,Only beverages were served on the flight. With the cost of the flight a pack of peanuts or pretzels would have been nice.
5996,Maybe variety snacks.
5997,"The food menu options need to change. I fly most every week. when honored with an upgrade, I find the menu options have not changed since June 1. It is time to introduce varieties."
5998,"The domestic flights, you have to be a member of united to get drinks. Can not pay by card or cash."
5999,This is the first time the meal was decent but not many options. Most of the time there is not much of a choice or not enough of the option you want or the food is terrible.
6000,"Food was actually good. portions could be a little bigger, especially for the prices we are now paying to fly in the first class cabin."
6001,Great coffee.
6002,No hay nada que decir.
6003,The quality and generosity of the meals do not equal previous years in business/first. It really seems that you have slipped and cut back despite the full fare ticket prices we pay for this class of service.
6004,Soda pop was flat.
6005,"While we were delayed I was surprised the flight attendants did not offer us a beverage, not even water. I expected more having paid to sit in first class."
6006,Delta and American offer a drink to the first class cabin on entering the plane. There was not enough of some main course items for all first class cabin customers.
6007,Bus class food should be better at the price I paid for ticket.
6008,No.
6009,Dessert was part of the meal.
6010,I could be better.
6011,"I remember when air lines Ofer food, I believe that for the price of the ticket the breakfast should be different."
6012,I did not get offered a variety of snacks. We had basil breadsticks. That is all there was. they were not good. The meal was pasta tortellini and it was ok not good. The ice cream was good.
6013,A healthy option would be preferred.
6014,People should be allowed to get to red wines at one time. Restricting to one seems unnecessary.
6015,So glad you had sparkling wine!.
6016,Food coming to Newark was good however the chicken meal going from Newark to Berlin had very minimal chicken and not very appetizing.
6017,No every was ok.
6018,The red wine is not very good!. I will get another option next time <☹️>.
6019,Sparkling juice and nuts.
6020,"For Polaris flight, please improve the presentation of the meals. It looks very cheap. Like microwave meals. Also the meal before landing just looked terrible."
6021,No Thank you.
6022,No inflight snack.
6023,Bigger portion and get rid of that Greek yogurt.
6024,"The cold grains salad of whole oat berries and other things was very good, and I was glad to see it because of how good oats are for diabetics. Bread rolls often seem very cold;. not sure there is a solution, but figured I would mention it."
6025,We were not given any snacks either segment of our flight.
6026,"from AMS to IAH was a LOT better then IAH to AMS, not sure it was the kitchen, the crew."
6027,No.
6028,I was very impressed with the service. the food quality I have not flown very much after Covid. I would definitely fly United really good experience.
6029,"Breakfast.. poached egg, not so good. Had a warm sandwich later that was pretty good."
6030,We were supposed to receive a midway snack but it [snack] was not offered.
6031,The no cookie was on my way back from Houston to El Paso.
6032,No.
6033,Limited availibility on the log flight from Denver to Hawaii and back. Would gladly pay for better amenities.
6034,The quinoa was good.
6035,Excellent.
6036,Good service and drink options. Wondering if the ground (at gate) beverage service for first class has changed. Sometimes ground beverage service is provided and sometimes not;. seems independent of flight length?.
6037,No.
6038,"I was surprised we got a complimentary beverage and snack, enjoyable!."
6039,I just liked having the option to be able to buy something more satisfying then the little snack bags.
6040,No allergy options ex-gluten.
6041,"On time , no issues."
6042,There was no complimentary snack.
6043,Just wish that one could get fresh milk with tea!.
6044,None.
6045,Please add a non-carbonated beverage option. Juice or sweet tea would have been appreciated.
6046,Chardonnay was not a good quality.
6047,"I did not partake of the food offered with my flight. The directions both verbal and printed about purchasing with only United credits, etc. I did not know how to access any of that and so did not know what was available to me in food or beverage. When I was offered food.. none of it sounded worth eating. so I declined both offers. From what I saw eaten and returns to the Galley not very many people actually eight some or all of their meal. I can only surmise from the smell and the look of it it is simply was not worth eating. As for beverages it is not clear of what comes with my first class ticket and what I would have had to purchase if I could have access to the United charge card service. The spiel from the cabin crew is simply not intelligible. I have very good hearing, despite my age. Regardless, the crew was a good one and most helpful."
6048,No pretzels or apple juice.
6049,No.
6050,"The hamburger meal should be changed to something else, the bread cooked too much where it is hard, not a meal for business class."
6051,They ran out of meat entrees and only had vegetarian options for the last 20 or so passengers. This was a full plane on a 7 hr flight.
6052,The entree was very tasty.
6053,I prefer low calorie snacks.
6054,Miss having the meal when flying cross country.
6055,Great food.
6056,No changes.
6057,Use a larger aircraft.
6058,Dessert was a cookie on the food tray that was adequate. Chicken was dry. side of tomato sauce was thick and bland. Vegetables and salad were very good. No snacks were served which would have been nice to have.
6059,Good choices.
6060,No.
6061,No.
6062,No.
6063,Beer was not cold. So replaced with wine which was good.
6064,Would be nice to have a larger snack for longer flights.
6065,Thanks for the services.
6066,"Food choice, or even a few additions, like more bread, cheese, crackers."
6067,Bring back the gummy bears or a chocolate option please. The almonds and banana were too healthy.
6068,I had food not the snack (I was thinking to select both). Just want to let you know the stir fried veggies are a bit odd. Soggy and salty sort of.
6069,The dinner (chicken) was strange.
6070,Have a seafood / fish option and less salt.
6071,They made the process quick & east. They had it down pat.
6072,No.
6073,It would be nice for KOSHER consumers if you had a certified kosher snack box available for PRE-ORDER (I realize that it would be impractical to stock every flight with kosher snack boxes).
6074,Small selection.
6075,The snack before landing was very nice. The main meal especially the Thai chicken was not great. Seems like the UA chefs could come up w/ something more appealing and tasty. Chef salad?.
6076,"American Airlines allows business class passengers to preorder their meals. United should as well. The choice between a pasta and chicken dish is not good, with no printed menus explaining the dishes. The quality of the food was ok, with the presentation substandard."
6077,I miss the warm nuts.
6078,Good.
6079,"I was pleasantly surprised by the frequency of ""feedings"". 3 times we got food service!."
6080,"not a good ratio of the options available for the premium plus cabin, the only item available was the chicken curry, had to ask for an item from the economy cabin."
6081,Did not love the lasagne. I was very happy the hot tea was pre made instead of dealing with a tea bag.
6082,"The breakfast was very poor after an intercontinantal flight, only a joghurt and a bar of muesli."
6083,I can not eat gluten so can not eat cookies or pretzels. I was handed cookies so took them home to my husband. It would be nice to have nuts or some option on such a long flight. Both options have gluten.
6084,I think that for a long trip. you should offer better snacks. 4 hours is a long time.
6085,A gluten free option would be nice or something that does not dry your mouth out so much.
6086,"The main course should be more ""natural"", with less add to preserve."
6087,"The chicken was spicy, We chose it [chicken] for the children but they did not eat it [chicken]. You should have let us known."
6088,"I flew first class, a variety of snacks were offered, I had the cheese and crackers, it was very fresh and good. I had to select Biscoff on the previous page be a use U was not able to move ahead without making a selection, this should be corrected on your survey."
6089,They should have provided a snack.
6090,I wish there was more fruit as snacks.
6091,Was looking forward to a snack w/ my coffee<🤷‍♀️>.
6092,I would prefer a quality cold sandwich option to a mediocre hamburger.
6093,Delicious.
6094,Food MUCH BETTER then befor.
6095,No.
6096,More options would be great.
6097,Yes.
6098,menu could stand more variety.
6099,"Very helpful, very lovely people."
6100,Just wish for my sprits I could have had the little bourbon bottle to use as I drank my beverage. It was a nice drink. I rather drink a bit at a time adding as I go.
6101,No.
6102,"I think you are WASTING MONEY on the kosher breakfasts. The heated portion is absolutely INEDIBLE;. I have NEVER seen any of the kosher eaters on United actually eat the kosher breakfast. They ALL get thrown away. GET COLD CEREAL and offer a choice of Corn Flakes or Special K or Cheerios, and everyone will be happier."
6103,"Flight attendants should be offering water throughout flight. Despite the proximity of the business class kitchen to my seat, just 4 rows away, I was instructed to traverse the remaining length of the plane, to the rear kitchen area, to receive water. When I got there, I was given one small, half-size water bottle. As a premium passenger, I expected to receive an average size, 500 ml water bottle upon boarding, which I did not, and did not appreciate having to walk through the length of the plane to receive water, and a small quantity at that. The middle kitchen was darkened and not set up for self service of drinks or snacks."
6104,I have a gluten allergy. there was no options for me to eat.
6105,Preordered first class meal and was not able to get it [meal] on board because there were not enough of that particular meal.
6106,"We did not receive anything. Short flight. But my husband loved the cookie waffle,caramel snack on our first flight."
6107,no.
6108,NA.
6109,No.
6110,Since when the passengers do not get any food on international flights?.
6111,"Given that it was a 5+ hour flight, I think you should charge an additional $10 (or whatever the cost is) and provide a full mean again. 1 small snack does not really work on these long flights."
6112,Wish there were complimentary snack.
6113,Cookies.
6114,More choices for food and wine. The Chardonnay is not great (and I had two different brands—neither very good) and no option for Sauv Blanc or Pinot Grigio.
6115,N/A.
6116,Offer meal for night flight.
6117,No.
6118,Serve better English tea.
6119,Need some Pepsi products.
6120,N/A.
6121,I asked for water in my water bottle. they served me 2 cups. Why not just pour it into my container?. Wasteful.
6122,No.
6123,Beverages offered: water or sparkling wine.
6124,No.
6125,Need to improve choice and quantity of vegetarian food.
6126,"The snack packet with potato sandwich, bhujia and Parle G biscuits is not upto par for an international flight ."
6127,"Need to offer sugar free, clear drinks such as Sprite Zero for people who can not drink colored soda's or soda with sugar."
6128,I think it would be nice to STILL offer a free cookie/ snack….
6129,No.
6130,No.
6131,No.
6132,"When the flight is 102 minutes late, thereby arriving just before midnight, I think it would have been appropriate to comp the beverages."
6133,The snacks are not enough.
6134,I had bottled water with me so it was not necessary to get an additional beverage.
6135,No.
6136,On the 8 hour flight we were only given a continental breakfast. had I known before I would have had or brought food!.
6137,Give Economy more than one breakfast option and make sure the fruit being served is actually ripe.
6138,It was offered on the short flight. I just did not have any.
6139,Good job!.
6140,Keep up with the great customer service.
6141,Perhaps more wine will be good.
6142,I chose the lamb and it was very well done and dry.
6143,"Business class. Was told upfront that they only had eggs, all French toast options taken in pre-order which I had not done. I do not eat eggs. Flight attendant arranged for me to have something from economy. At same time though turns out was also served croissant, fruit, and yogurt which would have been enough if I would been told I was not just getting “eggs”."
6144,"None ,no comment."
6145,Regular Lay's potatoes chips would be nice !.
6146,Tequila please. And the red wine was limited.
6147,No.
6148,It better has more choices.
6149,It was good.
6150,The green salad with green goddess dressing was outstanding. The Spanish wine was also especially nice.
6151,It was very tasty.
6152,No complaints about the food or beverage.
6153,Vegan options would be fantastic!.
6154,No.
6155,None.
6156,"Sorry... delete my answers, no snacks were made available from Van to Houston, only drinks."
6157,"Either of the preorder options would have been preferable to our onboard choice, and far better than the second option. Just give us a heads up when the options change. The meals were determined and loaded hours earlier."
6158,See my remarks at the beginning of the survey.
6159,No.
6160,"Appreciate the special strict vegetarian/vegan meal. Felt the quality of the entries were good. The breads provided, which I believe are a gluten free, are not that great. Pretty flavorless."
6161,No.
6162,Why UAL insists on spicing up a chicken entree to the point it burns your lips is puzzling. Some of us like a more neutral seasoning.
6163,My meal was in Polaris lounge which was exceptional way to pre-board.
6164,No snack.
6165,For the pre-landing snack/breakfast a piece of hand fruit would be a welcome addition. I really liked being able to purchase my drinks and have it charged to the pre-saved card in the app. Given that hard seltzers are so popular I was surprised that was not a beverage option but I still enjoyed my drinks.
6166,"Red Wine was undrinkable, returned unopened bottle."
6167,Dinner was excellent. Did not care for breakfast although presentation was good. My husband enjoyed both meals. He chose pancakes for breakfast.
6168,"The meal I preordered was not offered on my flight, but then I was told it would be an issue getting a different meal. That situation does not make sense to me. If United decided not to offer the meal I chose, then why can not I choose a different meal?. Why should United dictate what I must have, when it is United's fault that the meal United offered me during preordering is not available?."
6169,I know is complementary snack but United should offer twice the complementary snack or a least 2 items.
6170,Bring back snacks on flights.
6171,"for a 6 hour flight, they only came through the cabin once for drinks. should have been at least one more time."
6172,A smaller window between the main meal and snack would work better. I was very hungry by the time the snack before landing was served.
6173,The food was fine. I have some higher expectations for a business class ticket.
6174,There can be a greater variety of items on the menu including vegetarian meals for passengers to choose from.
6175,"Given the length of flight (3 hrs) and the time of the flight (6 pm MDT)—an airline provided meal (dinner) would have been more appropriate, instead of an added expense to the consumer."
6176,No.
6177,No snacks?. Why?. Delta gives snacks on MLB to ATL and ATL to IAD but United no snacks to MCO to IAD. We did drinks in first class.
6178,The strip waffles are the shit!.
6179,Could not provide service due to flight time length and that was ok.
6180,"We were excited about the preordering option as we had not experienced it before. When we got on the flight, the flight attendant had no idea we had preordered and the option we selected was not offered."
6181,Please have more food choices available.
6182,Thank You.
6183,Please offer pre-mixed cocktails like Manhattans or Negronis.
6184,Hope you keep it up that nice.
6185,I was pleasantly surprised at the wonderful meal they were able to serve.
6186,N-A.
6187,I thought the food was tasty and fresh and was impressed that beer and wine are offered. even though I did not have any.
6188,Not at the moment.
6189,Wish the chicken was heated. It tasted weird cold.
6190,First class should serve kiddy cocktails.
6191,Thank you for the upgrade.
6192,should have kept passengers more hydrated with water.
6193,With premier diver expect food service.
6194,"You should consider also serving a small snack (pretzels, cookie, etc.)."
6195,No food or snacks served.
6196,So very polite.
6197,I think the contactless pay thing is extremely inconvenient.
6198,Consider serving Texas BBQ!.
6199,Everything was great.
6200,No snack was offered.
6201,No.
6202,The food is boring. But you already knew that.
6203,the available snacks between main meals seemed pretty limited compared to other companies i have travelled.
6204,Dinner was excellent. breakfast was terrible.
6205,One voice of beer and one choice of white wine only.
6206,I was not able to purchase wine bc my card was not submitted before the flight. How was I suppose to know thst’.
6207,"We have also had a meal. I could not return to the choice. This was the best meal I had during a flight in economy class. Thanks, very well done."
6208,"I asked for Tomato juice, to my delight. there are 2 varieties offered. of which I chose the spicy one. When the ice cup was delivered with the can, it included a nice lime wedge. Very satisfied with the overall juice experience!."
6209,No.
6210,No.
6211,I was going to purchase Pringles but I had to do it on your app I had cash and my card only. The flight attended gave me the Pringles.
6212,No.
6213,No.
6214,Snack in first class just pretzel or waffle was disappointing.
6215,No.
6216,"The complimentary snacks are small, which is not unexpected. The issue is that if flights are always late, then travelers have no time to buy food between flights. I encountered this issue in bot directions on my trip. I tried to buy food. the choices are limited. the items I chose were out of stock, further limiting the options. Be on time, so I actually have time to buy a sandwich at the airport."
6217,I wish you had biscoff cookies. The ginger is settling to my stomach.
6218,Belgian chocolate.
6219,A second round of becerages should be served as in the old days.
6220,"There were no free snacks provided. If you wanted something to eat, you had to purchase it. It would have been nice to provide a small snack, complimentary, with beverage service. Other airlines provide this."
6221,Ice tea Unsweetened or diet would be nice to offer. Carbonated soda have become less popular.
6222,The chargeback for the food orders was very slow to be processed. I have had to delay my expense report submission because of this. A hard copy of the receipt or an email to the same effect would have solved the issue.
6223,There was no service.
6224,No.
6225,I needed more water.
6226,None.
6227,It is a 30-minute flight so there is no time for service.
6228,it was a morning flight. so none of your items on the list above was available.
6229,Everyone knows flying economy is a hassle. Would be nice for everyone to get an unexpected treat sometimes.
6230,"Chicken with wine sauce, polenta and broccolini with a pretzel roll, salad and Eli's cheesecake was the best food I had on United in a decade. Would eat again."
6231,Just would like more gluten-free options or vegan options.
6232,No.
6233,No.
6234,No.
6235,was not offered food at all even for purchase. Was supposed to be free based on my status but was never offered.
6236,The dessert was a small bag of m&m I have received much better meal and dessert on all other international flights.
6237,Best coffee on a flight ever!.
6238,It would be nice to have cheeseburger as an option!.
6239,"A different cookie, like shortbread."
6240,none.
6241,That was a pretty long flight for a bag of pretzels or a pack of cookies.
6242,Bring back included food.
6243,"It was not truly bad, just did not meet my expectations."
6244,1st class on United = Southwest pre-pandemic offerings.
6245,Yes.
6246,Nothing.
6247,None.
6248,white wine was not really chilled.
6249,Business class food standard and quality have drop after Covid.
6250,Pretzels were lousy. The waffle cookies from the Netherlands on my flight to Traverse City Michigan last month were way better!!!.
6251,Need diet ginger ale. If flight attendants only give you a cup of soda they should offer refills or give you the can.
6252,Snacks Good and Good drinks.
6253,There was a beverage going but no beverage coming back. Same flight distance too.
6254,No free snacks.. no peanuts or anything?.
6255,Fot was very little. I left the plane hungry.
6256,"The meals were uniformly excellent, as good in taste and presentation as we would get in a good quality restaurant."
6257,United always stands out since it serves ice cream! <:-)>.
6258,Exceptional service.
6259,The option to preorder my meal was not available. Wish this was an option for me prior to boarding.
6260,"If possible, the flight attendents could come more often for ordering drinks."
6261,No.
6262,Good job.
6263,Long flights should be given more snacks.
6264,The omelette itself was fine but the accompanying items were boxed/cellophane wrapped items I would expect in coach and of lower quality than I expected in Polaris. The lunch items were similarly disappointing.
6265,"Sorry WA to Newark was great, previous comments were for Newark to Naples."
6266,i was refused entry into the Red Carpet Club in Denver with my Explorer Credit card passes - very very embarrassing and United should be ashamed to provide these passes and then turn customers away !!!.
6267,I found a tiny bag of pretzels to be a bit little for a flight of this duration.
6268,"It was useless to pre-order since neither one of us received what we ordered. Nevertheless, the food was good & tasty."
6269,Snacks - do not bother with offering them.
6270,"Wish food was like before, it was better."
6271,distribution timing and process was excellent.
6272,The main course was great I had the soba noodle salad as a snack later in the flight and the soba appeared to be linguini that was overcooked and overall the salad lacked flavor.
6273,No.
6274,No thank you.
6275,"Dinner was warm though roll was cold. Breakfast had a very cold, nearly frozen, croissant and a nuked egg that was so overcooked it was inedible."
6276,Better vegetarian food please.
6277,Not enough food options.
6278,Nob.
6279,No.
6280,Too expensive.
6281,We ordered a food box and it [box] was never delivered.
6282,Buffalo trace is awesome.
6283,I was hungry.
6284,Your wines are not good enough.
6285,No. I just felt the food offerings were the poor point of the flight.
6286,nice if we got a cookie.
6287,"Normally when ordering gin and tonic the flight attendant will bring a glass, a can of tonic and 2 small bottles of gin so I can mix myself, however this time I was brought a pre-mixed very weak gin and tonic!."
6288,Disappointed that on seven hour flight home from Washington to Edinburgh we were only offered two hot drinks. One in the first hour of flight and then one in the last hour of flight. Leaving a gap of five hours without refreshment.
6289,Only choice was curries.
6290,Cook served.
6291,Like the sparkling water options!. The rest of the food is fairly rough in coach.
6292,I was not offered ice with my warm can of soda. I did not notice until the flight attendant was past my row so I let it go. And no pretzels??.
6293,You could let customers have a bottle of water as soon as they get into the aircraft. You may have green tea available as well.
6294,On a two hour flight I am not worried about it.
6295,The veggie Chile was delicious.
6296,No.
6297,"Happy that meal service is back in first class, however it is now the same two choices on every flight."
6298,It was good. The problem was I had a connection with the same options.
6299,Did not get email in advance for ordering a meal before flight.
6300,"flavored, unsweetened seltzers would be good. Better vegetarian options would be appreciated==something other than various forms of pasta underlying a few soggy vegetables."
6301,All was generous.
6302,Food items were unsatisfactory. Bread was served without butter.
6303,More bourbon options.
6304,Cheese tray is a keeper.
6305,I was able to choose the meal prior to the from Houston to Las Vegas but was not offered that option for the return flight. There were more options to choose from on the first flight.
6306,Coffee - no decaf option available.
6307,Please bring back the built-to-order ice cream sundaes in business class. They were a highlight and a favorite of the old service.
6308,"I would like more preflight selections to choose from, especially some hot items. And more healthy snacks."
6309,The chicken served was very spicy so I could not eat all of it. Also the red wine that was served did not taste that good.
6310,Ice cream and mystery salad were not good Chicken and rice very average.
6311,It was SO much better than what was served from Washington to Madrid!.
6312,It was very nice to have pretzels and a hot coffee.... much appreciated!.
6313,N/A.
6314,All food was for purchase. We were on the plane for 4 hours. all we got was a biscuit.
6315,I enjoyed an entire can of ginger ale and it was nice to have a cup with ice to pour for a refill.
6316,"I enjoyed the wine offered. The food was adequate, but could have been served hotter."
6317,Chicken taste was average. Hard. More shoe like texture. unpleasant.
6318,Better wine selection.
6319,Not at this time. I think I chose not to receive a beverage due to portion size.
6320,"The dinner meal we had was chicken and rice,, the chicken and rice were fine but the sauce was a little spicy,,, I think it would be better to just serve chicken and rice and offer up a package of spicy sauce if a person would want it. Thank you!!!."
6321,No.
6322,No Comments.
6323,No.
6324,"Please use reusable cutlery ( knife, spoon, fork) and less plastic equipment to avoid refuse. And allow the refill of muss."
6325,You need a wider variety of entrée in business class.
6326,no.
6327,Yes.
6328,Crown.
6329,"I had preordered beverages for me and my seatmate. On board, I showed the flight attendant my confirmation. he acted like he did not know what was going on. Then he tried to charge me a second time for the beverages."
6330,Actually there were no food or beverages on the South Bend to Chicago flight . . . I was attempting to address the Chicago to Phoenix portion.
6331,For first class I feel like your snack options are inadequate.
6332,1st class could have been offering more beverages to me during return flight. Flight to Austin was great.
6333,Because of the delay flight at least give us free meal or snacks.
6334,"Again as a 1K member, gave a glass or soda with 1/3 ice instead of a whole can. My husband had to ask if I can have the whole can."
6335,"No, it was okay."
6336,Could be larger portions. Prices need to be cheaper for purchase of other items.
6337,There have been a few times that we preordered and then we found out during the flight that we were getting something different. On this flight we received what we preordered. Thank you United!.
6338,Too small.
6339,More selections especially for vegetarians.
6340,None.
6341,"Yes, the bun that is served with the meal is horrible. Very chewy so i just took one bite. If it would not have been there the would have been ok too."
6342,Only one choice.
6343,Free cocktails on these long haul flights.
6344,United is falling behind it US airline competirá in the quality and choice of food it provides. I keep be offered the same average/low quality meals. Historically I moved around the menu now there is usually just one choice that appeals and that is average. United can do much better.
6345,I touched the wrong button before. I did get a complimentary meal. And was very good.
6346,Live the sparkling water brand.
6347,Please tell the kitchen that a huge chunk of unripened melon is not a winner.
6348,I would prefer a larger snack mid-flight than chips or a chocolate bar.
6349,NO.
6350,It would have been nice if the water was cold especially when you get no ice in your cup from the flight attendant.
6351,I think it is time to offer better snacks in first class.
6352,Surprisingly good & plentiful.
6353,Pretzels were a little stale.
6354,No.
6355,No plastic cutlery served with food!!!. Had to chase flight attendant to ask for it!. Ice cream was damaged and leaking and served as such - I have never had that experience ever.
6356,Would have liked a bev.
6357,Okay.
6358,I always bring my own snacks.
6359,Softer snacks.
6360,I was never offered a choice of food.
6361,No free snack offered either cookie or pretzels.
6362,Menu options were not great. Most too spicy or too much ‘tomato based” I would have liked a simple option of cheese and fruit. I selected the “Cheeseburger”. It was pretty plain with just fruit.
6363,They did not offer any snacks - it was a morning flight.
6364,it is non-existent - totally depends on the flight attendant - some make it happen some just do not and instead do a stupid credit card bit.
6365,Bumpy flight. Attendants were rushed to serve refreshments.
6366,would like Green Tea to be part of the service.
6367,No.
6368,The food at United has improved. Last year I would not touch it.
6369,Would like ability to pre-order meal for return flight (which my DCA-SFO was). Have not been offered that.
6370,Cheese and fruit tray was just right. Very well presented and tasty.
6371,The food tasted great.
6372,Please provide an option to pre-order food with no onions. The staff did not have the full ingredient list and could not really tell me for sure which option had onions or traces of onions. I would have preferred an option to select 'no onions'. It would be great if I could at least browse my food options via the on-board Wifi to make my choice by the time the flight attendant comes through the cabin.
6373,"The vegetarian meal, while truly vegetarian and most appreciated, was cold and underwhelming. 12 black beans and 1/4 of an avocado was not a ""meal."". Long overseas flights and a dinner should be hot and a bit more substantial."
6374,The quality and taste of the food was just fair. You need a new food provider.
6375,I missed the breakfast.
6376,No comments.
6377,No.
6378,It would be great to offer some sort of gluten-free snack for purchase.
6379,"If not preordered you can not get snacks, etc."
6380,It is average. Nothing special. Just OK.
6381,"Add back more real meat choices, and less vegan stuff!."
6382,"Ok, I only need hot water. I brought my own teabag."
6383,Just that your flight attendants were not very friendly or enthusiastic or into their jobs.
6384,The inflight meal and selections did not appeal to me or my husband at all. The flavor was not very good for the chicken and the other alternative might have been better if we knew what it was.
6385,United needs to change snack box and business class food Offerings. I have had the same menu for the last two years of traveling with United domestic US and Caribbean routes.
6386,"Coffee can be stronger and more tasty ,it is a pretty weak taste."
6387,It was great. thank you!.
6388,"Nothign, thanks."
6389,"Breakfast service was OK, but not filling enough. A very small sandwich (no options — you got whatever was handed to you) with no additional snacks was provided much later and was insufficient for such a long flight. Would have also liked to have seen at least one more beverage service during the flight, not just constant trays of water."
6390,Caffeine free beverage.
6391,More wine.
6392,The tea was not hot.
6393,Would have preferred a light hot snack for breakfast rather than yogurt.
6394,na.
6395,Complimentary snack sandwich was still partially frozen.
6396,"Dinner was good. I can tell quality has improved from some years till now. Breakfast on the other hand, even though it has also improved, is very small, so one item or two could be added to the breakfast box."
6397,"Si. El snack de desayuno fue un yogurt con una rebanada de pan dulce. Deberia considerar alguna alternativa para el lacteo. Por veganos, etc. O -como yo- no consumo derivados de leche. Tal vez un sandwitch, como lo que sirvieron en el tramo Amsterdam-Houston excelente!!."
6398,Should offer lemonade on flights.
6399,More variety on the snack. Increase portion. One snack (biscoff) was not enough for me.
6400,Snack selection could be improved.
6401,The range offered was minimal.
6402,It was a small plane so it was just perfect.
6403,The bread with dinner and breakfast was not very good.
6404,Better snack will be good.
6405,It was great!.
6406,"In business class, we did not get offered a drink before takeoff. For the overnight flight, I was not able to get coffee when I slept through breakfast."
6407,No.
6408,I did not want any thing.
6409,The Kosher breakfast meal was disappointing (Business Class ticket). I think the supplier needs to rework the menu and presentation.
6410,No.
6411,Very good.
6412,Excellent salad.
6413,The snack was not very interesting. Water was not as available as I would have liked.
6414,Ask passengers for another round of beverages especially the ones that comes in a tiny cup.
6415,"For air plane food, both meals were very good. We had breakfast on our way out to LA. The waffle was awesome. On way back, we had dinner. Not to much of a selection, but it was good. We were finally able to use our club passes. I can not believe we have not used them before. We will never pass them up again!. We had wraps, snacks, tea, coffee & soup. They had a full bar. All complimentary. Very very pleased. Oh, there was not a bad view from any seat in the club house."
6416,No.
6417,Chicken entree very spicy.
6418,More variety for options or just something more substantial.
6419,Ok.
6420,No.
6421,Food and beverages were not served due to shortness of the flight.
6422,The impossible meatballs my wife ordered were no nearly as good as last flight. It went uneaten.
6423,Very nice pleasant service.
6424,The contact payment worked easy on the DC flight but not the Cincinnati flight.
6425,No.
6426,"Snacks for free, bring those back please."
6427,No.
6428,Ít was great.
6429,"Delicious breakfast - only suggestion would have been to offer something else later into the flight, even pretzels!."
6430,It would be nice to get a snack.
6431,No.
6432,More variety of entrees…. Choice ahead of time.
6433,No.
6434,Would like some meals to not include gluten. All options often have pasta or a bun.
6435,"This flight did not serve bread, roll, muffins or pastry!!. Please provide bread or something on all flights."
6436,No.
6437,"One of the cans of soda was totally flat... no carbonation, could have been outdated."
6438,Much slower my side of plane than neighbors side. Seat g. Plane was chilly. she has 2 cups of tea before I got one. She was offered a third and we never got a second service offer.
6439,Do not like the desert. Need to be replaced with something else. The brownies tastes awful.
6440,Nope.
6441,The breakfast meal was good and presented in an appealing way.
6442,Meat was very dry and overall food quality not in par with other airlines business class offerings.
6443,Very helpful ground personnel during check/in.
6444,"The one small cup of water that is offered is not enough, you'er done drinking before the flight attended leaves your row. Flying makes one thirsty."
6445,"My complaint is with the First Class cabin food options. Three of the four trip legs were in First Class. Certainly, the TUS-DEN flight should have had some kind of breakfast."
6446,I miss the honey roasted peanuts.
6447,I was disappointed there were no gluten free complimentary snacks.
6448,The snacks should be free.
6449,No.
6450,More variety of scoth will be nice.
6451,The food was delicious.
6452,I like to drink cognac.
6453,Only snacks were available from St Louis to Denver and nothing from Denver to Albuquerque.
6454,An option of actual water would be very much appreciated- dansani (or whatever the “water” option was called) is not water.
6455,"We are flying regularly this month and have had both available first class entrees twice. They are fine, but it would be nice to have different options on the flight in one direction, rather than the same options both directions."
6456,You never seem to have the cheese platter.
6457,No.
6458,Great flight attendants.
6459,no it was great.
6460,"On my first flight from Queretaro to Houston, overflights did not even looked at me to offer me anything, on my other flights everything was perfect."
6461,"Stella ran out after just one beer, seemed to be no water fountain to fill bottles."
6462,There should be more variety or choice of food for purchase.
6463,"There is. I had only coffee , therefor nothing to talk about it."
6464,For economy plus a few more snack choices. I compare to Delta.
6465,Thank you.
6466,"The Impossible Meatballs are very yummy. I do not know why UAL uses those tiny wine glasses that are about as big as a thimble, but in any case, the FA was very good about bringing wine."
6467,No.
6468,No service.
6469,Borhing.
6470,R.
6471,"I thought I could get the kona. But in the fine print its only available on flights to Hawaii. Although, I can get that in any grocery store in Colorado."
6472,"Dessert was added to the food tray, rather than delivered separately with coffee after the meal."
6473,"The belgian waffle was not very good due to the sauce. However, the fresh fruit cup and Chobani yogurt made up for it."
6474,I got missed during the serving meal process. The selection was very limited (chicken or mac n cheese) and portions were very small.
6475,best aeroplane food I have ever had!.
6476,It would be nice to have some variety among the different kosher meals. Only a beef option was available (we generally do not eat red meat).
6477,Need Dr Pepper or Diet DP.
6478,"Only pretzels were offered. I suggest nuts also be offered so customers have a choice. The sparkling wine offered is low quality, a bit sweet, probably a prosecco. Again, there are many, many very competitive and much better quality sparkling wines UA could offer, e.g., cava from Spain, cremants from Loire, Alsace from France."
6479,Add 2 cookies and make the chicken entrée with out chicken and leave it a stand alone vegan option. It was excellent!.
6480,"Slightly larger portions would be great, long flight from Los Angeles to Orlando!."
6481,The cookies are not good. Have changed to pretzels. I hope you change the cookie taste.
6482,There was none.
6483,Please upgrade wine selection in Polaris.
6484,No.
6485,A breakfast bar would add to the choices.
6486,This flight did not have any complimentary snacks. The flight attendant said the catering did not provide the flight with the appropriate complimentary snacks and only provided food for purchase.
6487,No healthy options. Just junk.
6488,The actual meals did not compare to those of a flight operated by the Japanese airlines on their flight here. Waffles were also extremely soggy and did not have flavor.
6489,Please board at least two red and two white wines.
6490,Complimentary drink.
6491,Business class hot entree was pitiful in every way. Roll was pre-packaged and not fresh. Dessert was pre-packaged fruit cup (like in kindergarten). No warm nuts. No warm cookie.
6492,Need more variety of snacks.
6493,Pls try to get back healthy better free snacks which would the first in the industry.
6494,Offering a wine or drink did not seem available. Disappointing.
6495,Nothing else.
6496,None.
6497,Should offer free crackers or pretzels as before.
6498,Missed the pretzels and biscotti on the flight.
6499,No.
6500,"The food looked pretty unappetizing and frankly not at all special for a business class international flight. It all just comes out plonked together, there is no finesse or elegance that I would expect."
6501,No.
6502,no food was served.
6503,"I was able to pre-order on the IAD to sfo leg, but not coming back. Pre-ordering s preferable. The flight attendants were very helpful. my wife ordered one breakfast. they accommodated her when she changed her mind."
6504,I have to watch my sugar. The pretzel was offered on one of my flights from Orlando to Seattle. Only 2 options were offered Seattle to Denver both with sugar.
6505,"Sparkling wine mentioned in magazine, not available."
6506,Was satisfactory.
6507,A sandwich or warm meal would have been better. Or at least some dressing for the salad.
6508,No selection.
6509,you guys used to have Disarano i do miss that.
6510,No.
6511,I really liked the snack box!. It surpassed my expectations.
6512,I also ordered the egg sandwich and it was over cooked and the bagel was hard on one side.
6513,be able to order food/beverage before boarding.
6514,i did not like the waffle. they ran out of denver omelette. he asked me if i wanted to switch. in reality i did not want to.
6515,Expectations of food on flights is low.
6516,They should have more meals for longer flights.
6517,N/a.
6518,The entrees ran out of three of the four options in Polaris. We were told that because of staff meals the only thing remaining was pork and no chicken or fish were left. Later in the flight I saw the flight attendant eating the chicken dish. As a paying first class customer this felt incredibly irritating that my paid ticket does not allow me to have the meal choice I wanted so that a flight attendant can have her preferred staff meal.
6519,Needs improved.
6520,have a better selection.
6521,"Food was mediocre. Except for service and presentation, food could have been out of economy."
6522,"I do not like that I had to order - pre-order?. - from the app. How am I suppose to order anything from the app when my phone is in airplane mode?. I would have ordered food and beverages, and been glad to pay for them, if you had touch screen in-seat ordering. As it was I was hungry 6 hours after the meal service with 3 hours to go in my flight and a fast connection with no time to stop for food. Also the meal was not hot - barely warm - though it was good - and the ""snack ""of a microwaved sandwich was, frankly, gross."
6523,The food seems to be better this year. I like the recent offerings.
6524,There was no choice of snack it was pretzels or pretzels.
6525,"Food was not that good. My breakfast was not good, it consisted of a baggette with some spread on only 1/2 of it."
6526,Not at this time.
6527,You should find other ways of payment and increase the options. You have served the same things for YEARS now.
6528,Healthy options for snacks.
6529,There is no food from Guam to saipan not even beverage.
6530,Would have liked to have Jameson.
6531,No white wine!. Limited beer choices.
6532,Delay because of the jet bridge failure!.
6533,It was a morning flight. I understand Economy is not Business class but at $1500 a ticket the meal service seemed paltry. NONE of this should reflect on the flight attendants. They did a brilliant job.
6534,"Two cookies or a tiny bag of pretzels for a five hour flight kinda sucks. I imagine it is probably industry standard at this point, and I get that the economics of the whole enterprise are generally against the airlines, but wow did it make me nostalgic for the days a five hour flight for me enough of an inflight did service to have something to complain about."
6535,Better tasting and healthier snacks that are savory instead of just either salty. sugary snacks would be good to see. Allowing customers to choose better as the world moves towards a more health conscious lifestyle.
6536,No.
6537,I would like to see more Gluten Free choices.
6538,Limited food offerings for first class.
6539,None.
6540,I was not aware if I was ever offered any food or beverage services because I am ahearing impaired veteran. They may have said something but if I am not looking at a person I can not read their lips.
6541,No.
6542,Different snacks would be great.
6543,No.
6544,I was asleep during service of snacks. I woke up while serving beverages. Asked nicely for a snack and was told she would be right back. Never came back. Prior to this while being seated I asked for a wipe and some earphones. We rec'd total attitude after request. My husband had my bag and could not grab wipe while boarding. Unnecessary crankiness.
6545,Pretzels tasted funny.
6546,"We were given a cup, not the can."
6547,Please given the whole can without having to ask.
6548,Grilled avocado seemed a little mushy.
6549,Bland.
6550,"on a 4 hour flight, a second walk through for beverages would have been nice."
6551,No top shelf liquors free.
6552,Thanks.
6553,I wish we had been offered a snack.
6554,"We did not pre-order because we did not like the selections, and the only one I would have ordered was not available. The selections were not appetizing. we do not eat pasta, rice, or wheat, or sugar. there really was not much for us to order."
6555,i got a whole can of diet coke and that was awesome.
6556,No thank you.
6557,You should include better snacks free of cost. Even your purchased items were not sufficient.
6558,No.
6559,No.
6560,There was no free food. No cookies or pretzels.
6561,I requested a gluten free meal and it [meal] was served with items that contained gluten. I read the labels so I did not get sick but that is irresponsible.
6562,"We sat on the tarmac for a very long time without any communication about what was going on, what to expect, etc. The very least that could have happened is you could give the passengers complimentary snacks -- more than pretzels. Do something to help make us feel ""not so awful"" for all the things we would have to reschedule because of this delay."
6563,One complementary waffle cracker snack on an over 5 hour flight…. unsatisfactory.
6564,"We flew first class several times during COVID on United and were so very disappointed in the food. It is great to have the real first class food back!. We wish we had flown coach during COVID. First class was very disappointing and not worth the extra cost. Also, it would be great if you offered spirits before takeoff. It really makes a difference."
6565,Very nice.
6566,"Could have had 2 options of kind of wines, not only 1 of each flavor."
6567,"Dinner had been very good. Breakfast can be improved, as the food looked pre-prepared (as it is, but usually the customers will not see / feel it) with the bread softened in the liquid."
6568,Chicken dish was a bit too spicy.
6569,no.
6570,I chose the ice cream and it was mealtied.
6571,There should be a sugar free option for dietary needs.
6572,No.
6573,No.
6574,it would be good to offer non- sugar snack to diabetic passengers.
6575,Vegetarian meatballs is excellent. The second option offered chicken and rice does not taste good at all. Is a “big salad” an option?. Maybe pre-order only if not.
6576,No.
6577,"The flight attendant lisent me talking in spanish and he started talking to me in that way, it was special."
6578,I miss the old omlette's on international flights in economy/economy plus.
6579,"I like the contactless payment option – very convenient for passengers, probably better revenue capture for United <:)>."
6580,They did not have enough vege sandwiches for vegetarian people & they had only potato chips!!. We had informed about our food preferences when we booked the flight!!.
6581,More vegan options needed.
6582,I enjoyed getting a full can of soda with glass of ice instead of it being poured for me.
6583,Sweet tea.
6584,I ordered Cranberry juice and was served a half full can.
6585,Being frequent United flyers. I get tired of the same/limited snack items.
6586,The Impossible Meatballs were very nice.
6587,No.
6588,Coffee Luke warm and bitter.
6589,It would have been nice to have a choice of desserts when preordering my meal.
6590,I love the new snacks. The lemon frosted almonds and waffle cone bites are delicious.
6591,I was not aware of any meal options. It seemed like there was only beverages offered.
6592,no.
6593,Only Stroopwafels and pretzels - no Biscoff cookies.
6594,"I did not see where I could get a dairy free option. When they arrived at the rear of the plane, there was no longer a vegetarian pasta option. I would have liked to have had my food allergies taken into account."
6595,Best coffee ever had on flights.
6596,Very unfriendly server/flight attendant.
6597,Great customer service delivery.
6598,"We got vegetarian...it was with a far east Indian influence. It was a TOO spicy <🔥> for both my husband and I. We are glad we got vegetarian 100%, but it was too spicy."
6599,"I had Champagne. I always look forward to that or a quality wine. Would have liked coffee too. by the way, the First Class Crew was very attentive. the two men were the best my husband and I have experienced. We travel the World……used to."
6600,Great Pinot noir!.
6601,NA.
6602,the choices are very limited and availability too especially on flights lengthy but not over 3h. so IAH to NYC almost 2h40min to get there. it would be great to have some options available.
6603,Pancakes were soggy. The dinner was good. the breakfast really was not.
6604,Have options not just one.
6605,"I miss the good old days of airplane food;. plastic fork, tray and all."
6606,I was given both treats because I could not make my mind up.
6607,I think the entrees could have been better.
6608,Snacks like pretzels or cookies.
6609,Everything was good.
6610,Only 2 improvements needed. The croissant was super cold and dry. the mango did not have any taste.
6611,"Kale egg entree was really not very good. Not hot, no flavor to speak of. Not good enough for a first class entree. Fresh fruit was good."
6612,I wish United would state exactly what you are being fed on a 9 hour flight. That is a long time to go on a roll and fruit.
6613,Liked it.
6614,The chicken tikka masala was very good. Would have preferred a choice of breads rather than just a dinner roll.
6615,I was not able to cut the broccoli due to it was not cooked well enough or was too cold. The vegan meatballs were tasty. The fruit dish was fresh. The rice was way over cooked and mushy. The flight attendant was very kind and found milk (though it was warm) for me to drink with my meal.
6616,"There is a giant waste of drinks and plastic for first class passengers. The flight attendant prepares a tray of sparkling wine and water and takes that around to first class to ask who wants what. When there are leftovers, the flight attendant dumps out all of the drinks and throws away the plastic. Why not have the flight attendant take the first class members' orders before pouring out drinks that will inevitably go to waste."
6617,The main meal was pretty good (= better than average airline food) the desert was a brownie that not very good. The snack was a sandwich that was bad = bad quality ingredients. The breakfast was good but not as good as the main meal.
6618,thank-you for the gluten free meals. On other airlines they did not have such an option.
6619,"Gif the length of a flight & price of a ticket , it is a disgrace that you are offered 1 cookie. I know it is yrs ago.. when I flew to Hawaii on this airline , had a full meal served in monkey pod bowls & had s snack . I was lucky with my connecting flight I had 25 min to get something to eat for an 11 pm departure .. I had not had anything to eat since 9am prior to my initial departure from Kauai. The price of a snack box is ridiculous .. not good I care yo eat too."
6620,No comment.
6621,Newark to Montreal leg was fine. Amsterdam to Newark leg could have done with a slightly more substantial lunch.
6622,"Actually I wanted to compliment the selection!. I prefer flavored sugar-free soda water and did not expect to find any on an airplane menu, let alone two flavors of it. Kudos for having healthier options!."
6623,I wish at least a sandwich was provided.
6624,No.
6625,Lack of times passed through the cabin offering beverages so a self serving water station would be nice in the galley area.
6626,Meals on this flight were especially good for “airplane food”’.
6627,Nuts were not an option meaning there was nothing that was gluten free.
6628,Would have liked meal options.
6629,Too limited.
6630,Providing a credit card online when preferring not to register for the app was confusing. There was nothing to confirm that my payment information was on file to know if I could purchase a beverage. The payment without signing up was confusing.
6631,I wish there was less plastic all around.
6632,Please care for senior passengers from India - They need healthy food - Please Note we Indians are foody - Please care for more good food - Ultimately it will help UA to increase business.
6633,You need to have a better quality.
6634,No snack offered. No purchase food offered.
6635,Only the snack boxes were available and no sandwiches.
6636,The snack was nothing to appreciate.
6637,Better choices would be nice.
6638,Food was very bland...needs more seasoning.
6639,Food service needs to continue. My last 9 hour flight to Hawaii did not serve food. Glad to see this returned.
6640,I did not select pretzels b/c I was given a small bag of nuts in 1st class. I wish they had a better selection especially with the extended delay.
6641,It was great- the oatmeal-chia was served to be cold and it was and other items were rearm like they were supposed to be- the oatmeal- his was good- fruit was not mushy - liked the biscotti too!.
6642,More snack choices.
6643,Improve upon meals option & taste.
6644,No.
6645,No.
6646,For a nearly $3k ticket in first class I expected better snack options. What happened to Sundaes or seafood appetizers. No appetizers at all and entire meal served at the same time.
6647,no.
6648,It would be great if you could reduce plastics (e.g. not for every beverage a new cup / no cups for cans / bread from a basket without plastic etc.).
6649,Not only light beer please.
6650,It was nice having a snack on the flight.
6651,"Had a meal included with FC seat, it was awful."
6652,"The trip to Seattle from Chicago. apparently the app did not work. the flight attendant shared she could not give me free drinks (which I never asked for)!. On the way back to Chicago, the app would not connect to my wallet. I have no idea if it worked."
6653,kind of missed the peanuts we used to get.
6654,No.
6655,I loved the turkey cheese sandwich on pretzel bread. That was amazing.
6656,"The dinners provided by United have really gone downhill. Even now the pandemic is less of a problem there is limited choice, if any."
6657,Keep being great.
6658,I would like to have the bottle of spirit ordered so I know what I am drinking instead of an already mixed glass.
6659,We were in first class so paying did not matter but I heard it announced that the only way to pay in main was with United App. I think you should take credit cards.
6660,THIS WAS SECOND FLIGHT HAVING PROBLEM WITH CREDIT CARD SHOWING I HAD SUBMITED MY CARD NUMBER.
6661,"Be nice if there was a wine choice other than white or red. Dessert was very good I was offered two entrees. I picked one. Guy behind me was then offered a hamburger, I was not and probably would have chosen that."
6662,"For international flights, food can be better."
6663,When it came my turn to have dinner they were out of beef. The flight attendant KNEW there was limited beef dinners. Her answer to this problem was forcing me to choose another offering. Not much to eat on that 8 hour flight.
6664,Food and beverage were very good.
6665,the wine were no good.
6666,I really appreciated how well you considered and remembered my wife's gluten allergies.
6667,Are there anything for diabetics.
6668,"Food was better than expected, honestly."
6669,Should be available at least water always.
6670,I did not accept the dinner.
6671,Be nice to have other non sweet options. Popcorn/ chips?.
6672,"On the trip from Houston to Buenos Aires enough food, snacks and beverages were served. It is on the ""short"" flights were more options (beyond pretzels, cookies, etc.). Thanks."
6673,No.
6674,Unsweet iced tea would be great…. People can always use sweetener packets to sweeten but you can not un-add it from sweet tea.
6675,"The early flight, which I preordered , did not have but two choices . The second leg had more choices but did not preorder .wanted oatmeal but you ran out. I could not eat much on first flight due to allergies."
6676,No tea selection.
6677,No.
6678,A snack would be nice.
6679,Will suggest getting better snacks.
6680,Wish a light snack like pretzels or cookies were offered complimentary.
6681,You never have revive snack box which I prefer.
6682,No.
6683,no service.
6684,"Instead of buying food, a small cookie to go with your coffee would be nice. Thx."
6685,"no pretzels or chips, nuts, etc."
6686,"No individual water bottle provided, not even for purchase."
6687,No.
6688,I was very surprised to not receive a snack on this flight. I have flown this same route many times before and previously received a snack.
6689,N/a.
6690,Hot Breakfast-- egg and chicken sausage not good.
6691,Ran out of apple juice. settled with tomato juice.
6692,I could have used a snack/ but it was ok.
6693,I WAS ON THAT PLANE FOR OVER SIX HOURS AND ALL YOU OFFERED ME TO EAT WAS A COOKIE that is PATHETIC.
6694,Not at this time.
6695,"What I was unhappy about was that I had not eaten because of my short connection, It said to download a payment on your phone to purchase food on board. Well the app would not open because of wifi. So hungry."
6696,Nothing.
6697,"I find the food to be pretty mediocre on united unfortunately. Have had a lot better food on other flights including Asiana, Lufthansa and Delta."
6698,thank you united airlines !!!.
6699,Wish United would offer the cheese plate in sufficient quantities on all flights.
6700,Main course meal of pasta not exciting and snack roll later not great. A Choice of sandwiches of the quality offered at any shop in the airport would be a more attractive option. I have cream for dessert is great.
6701,The burger was over cooked but the main meal was good.
6702,Ice was melted.
6703,The cookies are great but would have loved more than one.
6704,Dinner was appetizer & satisfying. But breakfast was terrible: croissant was dried out / very hard;. and the egg was disgusting: so over cooked it was inedible.
6705,None.
6706,"I would like to see real vegan options, not just crackers, or chips…but it did not bother me at all…it is just a thought."
6707,Lime would of been nice.
6708,"Not very tasted, but what does one expect these days!. The heady days of first class on BA and PanAM date back to my relative youth in 1970s and 1980s."
6709,"I had preordered my meal on the app. However, apparently it did not go through. there was no record on board of my preorder. however, I was still able to get the entree I wanted."
6710,Maybe a couple more domestic beers.
6711,No.
6712,The chicken entree was spicy. The drinkable peaches are a “no” for me. I tried them and thought they were gross. Dessert was a fudge filled cookie and it was good!.
6713,a full meal should be offered premium travelers.
6714,unable to purchase some products with cash or credit card.
6715,No …. Early flight … i slept.
6716,Awesome.
6717,Like before chicken Sandwich.
6718,the sides that go with the main choice have gotten much smaller and much less appetizing.
6719,Free snacks.
6720,I think the attendants should have come around to offer water etc.
6721,<:)>.
6722,Did not show up for flight. Beverages were available. flight attendant found snacks.
6723,"The main meal, breakfast, was a nice combination. But the eggs sandwich was over warmed and stuck to the dish. I liked the fresh fruit for both meals."
6724,"Yes, it would be great if you could expand your wine offerings in the Premium Economy cabin with Sparkling Wine and a Sauvignon Blanc. I do not care much for Chardonnay."
6725,The chicken (chicken substitute) made my stomach upset. The roll was about as hard as a rock. The entire meal was cold.
6726,Nope.
6727,Gave 2 snacks. Other airlines only give 1.
6728,diet ginger ale would be nice to have or diet tonic.
6729,The sparkling wine was not good.
6730,More variety of snack offered for sale in red eye flights (like sandwiches) and go back to being able to use credit card to purchase.
6731,"I selected the meatball entree option. the portion size was good. the entree seemed overcookes, dry, and lacked any flavor pazzaz. Very bland. The dessert was some disgusting cookie that had the taste and texture of cardboard."
6732,The breakfast was not exactly what I would expect on a such long flight.
6733,How about just a plain bagel?. With butter or cream cheese. Do a test please.
6734,"Since we can eat only Kosher food, some of the questions like the desert part did not fit. I saw an effort to improve the food which i very appriciated: the addition of coffee and sugar etc in the tray and a trial to improve breakfast. I do not like potatoes in the morning, it is too heavy and i prefer the omlet that you had in the past than the new thing you gave which i could not recognized and did not like. The meat was soft which is good but sweet which i do not like. The Tortia with falafel was nice and a new thing."
6735,I bought food at the airport.
6736,No.
6737,It would be nice to have a small snack with the beverage. It is a small thing that makes the flight seem more comfortable.
6738,I bought a cheeseburger too and it was good.
6739,I love blueberry AHA!. I drink this every time.
6740,No.
6741,I did not receive a vegan snack. The flight attendants could not find it [snack] although I requested a vegan meal a week ahead of time.
6742,No.
6743,could use tastier dessert.
6744,No.
6745,I did receive a complementary meal which is one of the best in my experience. The new menu is a home run.
6746,Paying through the app is a pain.
6747,For a 9 plus hours i do not think the food choices was appropriate. Compare to Air France we would travel before in the Business Premium it is night and day services.
6748,I flew delta from Austin to Seattle. The meal service in first is markedly better than the choices I get on the flight from Austin to San Francisco or back.
6749,U ran out of ginger ale.
6750,So far so good .. but everything is overpriced for what u get.
6751,"This survey did not let me go back a page to correct the fact that I had a meal and not a snack. The main meal was fine. The light snack before landing was terrible and lacking in all sense of being called food. It was bland, soggy and chewy. It also appeared as if they ran out of stroopwafels for those at the back of the plane. A stroopwafel would have been better than the ham and cheese sandwich that was served."
6752,no.
6753,Flight duration not conducive to extensive food beverage service.
6754,Miss the complimentary wine.
6755,n/a.
6756,"The squash ravioli and chocolate chip cheese cake were not good. There were only two options to choose from, should offer more options."
6757,None.
6758,There was no snack.
6759,飲料OK!. 食物可怕!.
6760,"In my opinion, the quantities of foods or the extra food requiry could be responsed once the more left foods might be available during the fly though."
6761,I would like to be served water refills.
6762,thanks for the full can.
6763,No.
6764,More soda and salty snack options.
6765,Nope.
6766,I appreciate the hot meals being restored in 1st Class.
6767,Snack offerings were lacking in variety and portion size.
6768,The only problem with the meal served was it was the same same with every flight segment. Need to change the variables. Thanks.
6769,The Eli's chocolate chip cookie is too sweet.
6770,"If United had more snack choices-that would be great, but I did appreciate what was served."
6771,Would like complementary soda.
6772,No apple juice. Just orange available.
6773,it was nice to still get a free snack/drink.
6774,need to have Dr. Pepper.
6775,You should give a little snack no cost.
6776,The pasta was nice but unfortunately cold.
6777,"It is not the food in and of itself, it is just that Qantas has a far higher standard in terms of quality."
6778,No.
6779,"I would like to see some more options, like a cold sandwich or a fruit bowl. The hot sandwiches are a hot mess. The cheese platter would be better if 1/2 cheese and 1/2 fruit."
6780,no comment.
6781,"This is a general issue: as a vegetarian (lacto-ovo so eggs and cheese are fine) I find that the ""vegetarian"" meal is usually vegan or some more restrictive diet when the usual ""pasta"" choice is perfectly vegetarians. However, for the first time th choice was beef or chicken not chicken or pasta. Also the fact that I am vegetarian noted on my profile is sometimes noted and sometimes not. Why can not a pasta dish be reserved for the vegetarians on board before offering to everyone?. Also, It should be obvious that once tied to my frequent flyer account, a vegetarian option should be offered to the person in my seat?."
6782,"While very tasty, the Za'atar chicken was very dry."
6783,All good.
6784,More choices.
6785,no.
6786,Since it is a long flight it would have been nice to have food service a little later in the flight.
6787,Everything was fine it was a 3 hour and 44 min flight .
6788,Could only buy one drink at a time then it took over an hour to get a second drink.
6789,Why does not United provide lime or lemon with drinks like gin & tonic and Bloody Mary?.
6790,Breakfast snack is only sweet. Shall a good mix of sweet and salty.
6791,We had pretzels and some kind cookie or biscuit. It would have been nicer to have more of a substantial snack that we would not have to pay for.
6792,I think you should offer whatever snack we would like to eat. Not just one. I asked for two and got an eye roll from the stewardess.
6793,Nope.
6794,I liked the fact that the drinks were served quickly!.
6795,Tequila should be an option.
6796,The champagne was very nice. It was nice to be offered a glass just after being seated too.
6797,"We were told there would be a fruit plate. However, when the flight attendant got to us. we were told there were none left."
6798,No snacks were served.
6799,Thank you.
6800,A cookie is not enough. we are traveling on an airplane not in a bus.
6801,"The variety was ok. they sold out of the cheese plate. Also, the tray table was VERY slippery. the soda can easily slipped and spilled on me."
6802,"the sandwich was better than the one TO peru. which was not good, but I liked THIS one better. Y'all can find a better one I am sure."
6803,Been eating the same on all flights in the past few months. No options available. Please expand the menu and do not serve the same item over and over.
6804,Flight attendants did a great job serving us in first class. Attentive to detail.
6805,Would like to be asked if we want the entire can of soda and not just a cup.
6806,there was only a minimal food selection.
6807,"It was a 5 hr ((transcontinental) flight. I appreciated the ability to purchase food on board without having to pre-purchase, but I think for a flight of that duration you might consider providing a light, complimentary meal;. increase the fare by $5-10 or so to defray the cost if necessary."
6808,Most of the breakfast items were not available. I was seated in the second row of economy plus. Also not available for pre purchase.
6809,Would like to have sandwiches offered.
6810,"The couscous was mushy. the meal did not have enough sauce. But - pleasantly surprised with the taste. Delta's comparable dish is better - it is bigger, they serve with orzo and tomatoes. Also, why does United serve fruit with lunch and dinner?. It seems out of place."
6811,"For the price I paid for my ticket, more variety of free food/beverages would be nice, from Houston I flew to El Salvador."
6812,No.
6813,If you have Indian vegetarian no fish no eggs food will be good selection.
6814,Always satisfing.
6815,The biscotti were not biscotti-they were like granulated sugar on a ginger snap like cookie shaped like a breakfast biscuit from the UK. Just were not biscotti so should not be called biscotti.
6816,Food was better on this leg of our trip. as a I am not a large portion eater I would like the option of smaller meals as I hate wasting food.
6817,No.
6818,My wife can not eat anything with garlic or spices. There were very little options for her.
6819,No food offered on flight except snack box.
6820,Great!!.
6821,"I could not eat the meals served as you have no kosher options, even for Polaris passengers. Please bring these back."
6822,Food not as good on European Flights.
6823,Long flight to go with just small snacks.
6824,there was no welcome drink served because of a delayed departure. we had to wait 45 minutes in the plane.
6825,"No choice of snack, I find pretzel too salty. Special meal (vegetarian) was especially tasty."
6826,Pretzels and cookies were not offered because they had not been provided.
6827,Snack pack is overpriced.
6828,"If there was a menu, we did not get one. It is nice to receive the complementary items. we also like to see options for salw."
6829,The catering sucked!. Terrible food!. You need to up your game on that. get a better catering service!.
6830,Since person paid full price for seat and seat selection cost hundred dollar more then that you do not select seat at least deserve better snack.
6831,"I especially missed greens!. I took the pasta, because I did not want to eat meat, but the vegetarian dish was carbs (pasta) with carbs (potato salad) and carbs (bread). That is not a good diet to me."
6832,Pork was a weird choice I have never seen on a United flight. More than half of it was fat.
6833,I think a small snack should be offered at no extra charge to those that want it.
6834,N/A.
6835,"Neither food options looked appealing or tasted appealing. It can not be that hard. For the price of business class tickets, I expect better quality food and better options w wine."
6836,Would be good to have a list on the menu.
6837,"Being able to preorder meal was nice. First time experience with that, but that was great to be able to do."
6838,The selection should be more generic for peoples taste. Turned out that the chicken orzo was spicy and many people do not like or can not have spicy food.
6839,Overall a nice meal and snack!.
6840,Wish you had chips.
6841,Wine I requested was not available.
6842,"Gluten Free snack items please. I was not able to have a snack, due to Gluten Intolerance."
6843,Food was ok. we were not offered first choice as GS. We were lucky the option I wanted was available. I hate the fact that one item is now always vegetarian. The dessert was a dry cookie that I did not even try. The salad had hunks of carrots and corn on top. The chicken entree was decent.
6844,"Je me garderai, bien sûr, de comparer ce qui est servi aujourd'hui sur un vol transatlantique comme celui que j' ai pris avec ce qu' on nous servait pendant mes premiers vols dans les années 60/70. Mais je pense que ce que l' on sert maintenant est plus un passe-temps qu' un repas. Les produits servis sont de plus en plus basiques et la taille des portions diminue avec le temps. Pourquoi ne pas proposer un choix de vrais sandwichs, plus faciles à consommer dans l' avion que ces petits plats peu remplis qui prennent de la place sur le plateau. J' ai acheté en arrivant à SFO (parce que j' avais faim !). un sandwich (turkey, salade ...). dans un modeste snack-bar du terminal. Pas très cher, copieux et délicieux. Accompagné d' un verre de vin ou d' un soft drink, complété par un yahourt ou un petit dessert, une telle formule constituerait un repas beaucoup plus convenable que l' ensemble de minuscules portions sans goût que l' on m' a servi sur mon vol. Et plus facile à distribuer pour les hôtesses et à consommer pour les passagers."
6845,"I was satisfied with the beverage selection, but the snack selection needed something more satisfying. The options were the same as they would have been if I had flown coach for American Airlines. I had missed an opportunity to eat in the Club and had not had lunch, so I was starving. I ended up eating pretzels."
6846,no.
6847,Cheese plate not available.
6848,no.
6849,food snacks and beverage were just right.
6850,Pasta entree was simple but delicious!. As was the side salad. Waffle for breakfast was also great. Really the best economy class food I have had in a very long time!.
6851,Highly recommend providing the entire can to guests when ordering soda. thanks!.
6852,Flight too short no beverages.
6853,"Long flight, larger snack would be appreciated."
6854,Our world needs to have more customer service like United!!!. Thank You.
6855,like food from Lagos to USA do not like USA to Lagos change the Cook please to American cook.
6856,I would prefer if there were better homeland food options since the flight is from Lagos to Washington.
6857,Excellent and surprisingly good snack selection.
6858,Cookies.
6859,"The Entre was served cold, with a fruit plate & a banana - it just looked like a concoction of snack items thrown on a tray - for a 3.5 hour flight that had been delayed 2.5hrs. Pitiful."
6860,Surprisingly good food.
6861,Great to have metal utensils.
6862,No.
6863,keep up the good work.
6864,Flight attendants were amazing.
6865,I wish I could be given the option to receive a smaller can of soda or if the flight attendant could just fill a cups worth without providing the can. I find there is so much waste with customers including myself not finishing the full can and I always feel bad wasting it. Wish there were smaller cans or the option to have it poured in a small cup.
6866,"Hot food items in PP have slowly becoming almost better than comparable dishes in Polaris. This particular item was a ricotta?. filled pasta dish topped with chanterelles - it speaks for an attempt to elevate the food experience in pp. But there is still more work to do, especially re consistency. The Polaris food and service has even more room for improvement...but we will leave that for another survey where I have actually flown Polaris."
6867,No.
6868,It was ok.
6869,More choices on the snack dept. the price to buy something on board is pretty high for the quality of the food!.
6870,I appreciated that I was offered a cup or can. I only wanted the cupful which is rarely offered. Neither Brian nor Tyler were in a hurry while serving.
6871,Is ok.
6872,NO.
6873,On a 5 hour flight I expect to get a Sandwich or a light snack besides beverages.
6874,No.
6875,"There was not snacks, just beverages provided."
6876,"Food selection and presentation is moving a bit closer to where it was pre-pandemic. However, the desserts are still seriously lacking: the ice cream sundae is pre-portioned in glasses, sintered into one lump, rubbery in texture, really not very pleasing. The cake alternative was a gooey lump of sugar. Food will never influence my decision to be loyal to the United Airlines Business Class product. But Polaris used to offer a good dining experience and hopefully this will return at some point in the future. Also, it would be nice to be able to order Green Tea again, for now I have been bringing my own Green Tag bag aboard."
6877,Soda was great.
6878,was not hungry at meal time. Asked for a sandwich later (in Bus. Class) which was not available. Was hungry thru balance of flight.
6879,no was fine.
6880,"They ran out of unflavored soda water, they had limited wine choices - mostly USA wines that I do not like."
6881,"I put this in my other comments. The side served with the meal NEVER has been good (and has been the same for a long time). Also, on the way over, a knife is served with the breakfast, when there is nothing to use it on. (UA could save money.)."
6882,I rather enjoy the stroopwaffels and was mildly disappointed they were not available this time around.
6883,"Was not provided with meals ordered (A non meat order) Only one was provided. It was unfortunate. The passengers adjacent to me were also in my situation. Orders were not provided us. Although I appreciate being given a choice, perhaps half the time, it has not been available. Not earth shattering but on a very long flight, unfortunate. The crew also did not offer a snack or substitute for the meal missed."
6884,Few more vegetarian options would be appreciated.
6885,good that no charge for wine on international flight.
6886,An excellent red wine!. And the coffee had very good flavor.
6887,I fly Memphis to Denver often either the morning or afternoon nonstop (both are great) but the cheese tray in every flight gets boring after a while. I love United but a change up on the 1st class food would be a welcomed change.
6888,Very few choices for vegetarians!. I wish there is a vegetarian sandwich option!.
6889,Food was very good.
6890,"I was shocked that on a 15 hour flight there were no extra drink services, other than the one with dinner and the one with breakfast!."
6891,I would have liked more water on the flight to Lisbon.
6892,LOVE those little ginger cookies!.
6893,Used to offer food when fares were much lower.
6894,None.
6895,Ok.
6896,I would love to see bubbly or aha.
6897,"maybe just a cracker or pretzels?. When you have been flying all day with no time for food, a little something would have been nice."
6898,The tea didn't taste good.
6899,"2nd serving - snack was unappetizing. choice was cheese or turkey&cheese. I need to reduce my fat intake for high cholesterol, so I would have welcomed another option (salad, vegan sandwich?)."
6900,"We were offered 2 snacks, a meal and beverages - their timing for when snacks and the meal were distributed was excellent."
6901,No tank.
6902,The snack boxes are getting old. Would be nice to have hot food options on more flights and more variety of food options in general. The wine is OK. nothing to look forward to after a long week of traveling for work.
6903,"I know it is a short flight, just wish there was something more substantial."
6904,We did not offend any alcoholic beverages.
6905,Veg options could be lots better.
6906,"We did not want dinner. However, the flight attendant recommended refreshments which consisted of a warm roll with butter, a chocolate bran muffin, and fruit and Sprite. It was delicious."
6907,Better selection.
6908,I would like time to drink my beverage before flight attends rush you to pick up trash.
6909,Yea was very weak.
6910,It was fine.
6911,I HATE cashless paying.
6912,More choices like unsweetened ice tea.
6913,Very tasty. Good job.
6914,My meal was cold and inedible.
6915,Enjoyed pre-selecting food and the selection was good. The temperature and taste were great.
6916,Not enough.
6917,a cup of club soda was just enough to hydrate but not enough to go with the food and wine. I had to ask for an additional cup of water. Thanks.
6918,"Just that we only got a breakfast sandwich, nothing with it, not even a napkin, and it was messy cheese, where the plastic it was in was hard to open."
6919,would have better if more varieties food available and provided by including cost in ticket.
6920,No.
6921,Same food choices going and coming. Would be nice to switch it Up.
6922,change up the snack every couple years.
6923,Well I flew first class. Great. But just a bag of pretzels??.
6924,Making soft drinks free.
6925,"It would be nice to have 2 white wines and two red wines to choose from. Also, whereas the chicken on orzo and the Impossible meatballs are a HUGE improvement over the pandemic poor sandwich choices it would be nice to see new entrees every month for your frequent travelers."
6926,"United could take contactless paying with credit card tap and not require app use. The seats on 777 were not comfortable ,seats on ER135(00) much more comfortable. Otherwise the 777 is a terrific airplane."
6927,I think that a small snack could be offered at no charge.
6928,"i think the snack choices were junk food and could do much better. the veggie options sometimes were good, sometimes were loaded with sugar."
6929,"As we were at the back of the aircraft we never had an option as the alternative options were all gone. The ice cream was completely defrosted. The staff had to rush about finding side dishes to complete the meal. This had happened to us both times we have traveled this route, both inbound and outbound."
6930,Salad was not good.
6931,Thx for offering 0 calorie choices like Aha.
6932,i liked the tapas snack box but wish the Takeoff box was available. That one is my favorite. The coffee is the best. Do not change the Illy brand.
6933,Cold coffee.
6934,get cinnamon rolls back for breakfast.
6935,no.
6936,Both meals were the best I have had on a plane in a long time.
6937,We flew first class to Anchorage in August and were able to pre-order our meal. We were in premium (?). plus on this flight and did not have that option. That. Would have been nice as they ran out of the chicken option. So glad we got the last ones as I did not like the other choice.
6938,The white wine and vodka was of poor quality.
6939,"Bring back the old ice cream sundae carts. For gluten free, would like to be able to choose from the standard menus as well when it meets gluten free. Also, do not like gluten free bread / wheat as it does not meet the restriction I have for wheat intolerance."
6940,The staff was terrific!. Very good manners.
6941,Need better bourbon selection.
6942,No.
6943,Food was great. Absolutely no complaints.
6944,nope - it was a very late night flight 11:55pm so we were not that interested in much.
6945,I was just happy to get something to drink on such a short flight.
6946,everything has cheeses stop it!.
6947,No.
6948,Wish the snacks were non-GMO.
6949,More variety.
6950,No.
6951,The choice can be expanded in savoury.
6952,Good.
6953,Would have preferred a McDonald's burger and fries!.
6954,"The entre and and side salad were not very tasty at all. I am glad I brought my own snacks. The dessert was ice cream. I am lactose intolerant, so that was not a good option."
6955,"Water should have been offered more frequently / regularly - particularly on a long haul flight such as this one. A larger serving size would have also been helpful, rather than to have to ask for multiple refills."
6956,Would like to see different snacks offered than the regular pretzels and biscoff.
6957,expecting more Filipino dishes..
6958,chicken was not so tasty and the pilaf?. tasted like rice with worcestershire sauce. Bread was very dry wheat bread. Brownie for dessert was dry and sweet.
6959,More soda options.
6960,Oops we were not served anything on the madison - Chicago I was referring to Portland.
6961,"Yes was told club lounge was free , went up stairs after flight from akron , my wife was checking us in and a lady came up stairs like she was the police , i was trying to go to the mens room , she said you can not stay here, your wife did not want to pay the $69.00 dollars , i said can i please go to the restroom , she said ok , i guess , that was a little on the cheap side, attitude wise , we flew delta for 25 years , but they quite going to akron , canton . other than this episode with the club lounge, everything was ok , our neighbor told us club lounge was free, with first class we did not know ??. after spending about $8.000.00 on this vacation with , air fair hotels rental cars and meals , i laughed at the lady , i said, I am still going to the bathroom, you can arrest me when i come out , all around service was great ."
6962,i did not get my breakfast. i was sitting in Business Class.
6963,The flight attendant made second rounds with complementary beverages was attentive and tried to make the best of what he had.
6964,I very much liked having options other than the free snacks. I purchased a snack pack and it was pretty good and the contactless payment was very nice as well.
6965,No. Its fine.
6966,I think on a flight of this length. there should be a meal offering included.
6967,Should be able to get a snack with these prices..
6968,I did not require any.
6969,A snack would have been good.
6970,"While I understand it is a short flight, I seem to recall an actual light meal in first class in the past. None were served on this flight."
6971,I should have received a can of soda instead of just a small cup with ice with soda.
6972,Should be free considering the price of the flight.
6973,"When the drink cart came by I was told there is no alcohol offered on this flight. This is an International flight where alcohol is always available. I was upset that this was not available. However, a flight attendant did manage to provide a single beer to me so at least I was given that to go with my meager sandwich."
6974,Having NO contact purchase and needing to load a credit card before the flight is difficult. The only 2 on board options were sugary and awful.
6975,I long for the days when meals in first class were an experience. Remember a selection of cheeses?.
6976,No.
6977,"No snack offered from Chicago to Albany, considered too short mileage wise. when one is coming cross country and has to rush for connections, no time to purchase other food in Chicago, a snack is appreciated. The flight was essentially dinner time based on pacific time."
6978,I really wish there was at least 1 all gluten-free item to purchase.
6979,No.
6980,Did not serve any.
6981,Standards of food service have deteriorated tremendously as compared to preCOVID. Your main competitors now do a better job in this area.
6982,The chicken with rice or whatever it is is getting old. Need to have more variety.
6983,More/better vegan/vegetarian options would be great!.
6984,"I know it was a short flight, but it was lunch time period the snack should have been bigger."
6985,The snacks are quite lame.
6986,I wish they served a non-cola caffeine-free soda like Fresca or diet sprite.
6987,Coffee was weak.
6988,no.
6989,The payment defaulted to my business credit card. which is not acceptable since this was not a business expense. The flight attendant should have notified me first before charging my default credit card on my MileagePlus account. I needed to make this payment with PayPal QR code.
6990,Preorder food is so much better than what they offered on the plane.
6991,I ordered sparkling water and surprised they had it [water] available.
6992,I was expecting fresh fruit. Also the chicken and orso spinach was too dry.
6993,no.
6994,Should provide better snacks.
6995,The only diet sodas were Coke Zero and Diet Coke--both have caffeine. How about diet sprite or diet mountain dew or diet ginger ale?.
6996,A variety of free snack options.
6997,No.
6998,Chicken was too spicy.
6999,Food was not that great.
7000,"Aside from the snack that was ordered, paid for& not delivered, United did a very thoughtful job of providing free snacks to passengers waiting for the delayed flight."
7001,Are choice was limited. Passengers in first two rows had a greater selection. The chicken was fair at best. Should have offered mixed fruit as a dessert option.
7002,I ordered a vegetarian option/ non gluten/non dairy meal prior to the flight and the options were spotty at best. I got one vegetarian meal but any/all snacks other options provided either had gluten or dairy. Somewhat bummed...
7003,Hot tea or coffee.
7004,Love that you have buffalo trace.
7005,I responded for all 3 of my flights - all of which were good.
7006,No.
7007,"I had the chicken curry and liked it, but my wife had the lasagna and did not care for it."
7008,I have flyed many times on United. the food was so much better and the choices were at least 2-3 on most of my flts. Even economy.
7009,"As I said earlier, it was A LOT of food."
7010,"Tasty, hot & plentiful."
7011,I did not have a choice of snacks.... I was given pretzels.
7012,Very small quantities.
7013,"Choices were not offered,” what do you want?”."
7014,"Flying business class I would have expected a lot more food options and an even fancier food service. Polaris' past food service was legendary and industry-leading among American airlines, but it has really been pulled back. The old ice cream sundaes and the ""at-seat"" preparation of food is sorely missed. If I am going to spend close to $10K on a plane ticket, I would expect a bit more pomp with regards to the meals."
7015,There was no food. I was expecting peanuts or pretzels.
7016,You could provide a small snack like peanuts or a cookie.
7017,"Any chance you could offer another sugarfree/caffeine free option, other than sparkling water?. I do like it, yet might be nice to have another choice - sprite zero, fresca, sugar free root beer?."
7018,It was unclear how to use the app to preorder or pay for food.
7019,No.
7020,The glass was about 2/3 full.
7021,No.
7022,I like the preorder idea.
7023,On my return flight on 9/10 there was a problem with my request for my Gluten free meal (2nd snack) and the flight attendants went above and beyond to help me by substituting fresh fruit for the meal that was missing.
7024,"Standard, no issues with it. Chose not to have anything."
7025,"Now days nothing serve for this flight, you can serve at least juice."
7026,No.
7027,I wanted Bailey's but I was told it was not available.
7028,"It was a REALLY GOOD WAFFLE!. Would like it for lunch, better than what is usually offered."
7029,No.
7030,Didn't offer drinks with meal.
7031,Nice flight - i was tired i slept - i like United very much.
7032,"In business first on a domestic Polaris flight, I recommend offering a wider selection of wine."
7033,More fresh options would be good. There was no ability to pre-order the salad or hamburger on this flight for some reason.
7034,1-bring back read predeparture beverages (not only water or champage) 2-dont put snacks on the platform above the bulkhead seat. I do not want people congregating around my seat or standing over me while they look through a basket. Walk the basket around and put it in the galley.
7035,snacks for purchase were not offered.
7036,"The chicken served was very cold, I wish it could be at least warm, it made it taste really bad, but the snacks were okay."
7037,It would be great to have a couple more options in the soda selection.
7038,rather high cost for the brand served.
7039,The food is very basic and limited. It is also not very healthy. It would be nice if there was fruit or other options besides pretzels and crackers.
7040,All Good.
7041,Should be more meal options for a transcontinental flight. App said burger was unavailable so there were very few other options. I brought food aboard but would prefer to not have to do that.
7042,"The flight attendant serving beverages was delightful. Helpful, pleasant and hospitable."
7043,"I wish they give more biscoff, because one is not enough or either that 1 biscoff & 1 pretzel."
7044,I missed the usual pretzels and peanut offerings.
7045,None was served.
7046,Economy class should be offered good choice or given pretzels/cookie.
7047,The flight attendants do not mention when offering your free snacks that is the time to purchase food.
7048,None.
7049,No.
7050,"The cheeseburger was hot, but sloppy. The side dishes were not appealing. the dessert was a hard biscuit-like pastry."
7051,It is very good too.
7052,Would love to have more European Wine selections.
7053,Gluten-free snacks.
7054,I love having my card on file so it can be automatically charged.
7055,"There were no snacks offered, which is fine. But for an early morning flight, one of those cookies would have been great."
7056,Na.
7057,Na.
7058,no.
7059,No.
7060,Maybe provide good quality of non alcohol ie tea (not Lipton).
7061,I liked that there was just enough food I did not have to waste.
7062,"The waffle cookie was gross. The pretzel size was SO small, it was pointless to even offer."
7063,Meal was pretty good too.
7064,Chicken dish was substandard.
7065,"Please add options for people with dairy allergies. We always fly First. Business and my wife is never able to eat anything since all the options have cheese, milk or butter. Also, flight attendants should be given a list of ingredients of all meals served. They rarely know if meals contain any dairy. Other airlines provide that information to flight attendants. Thanks,."
7066,A small cookie or pretzels would have been nice. the glass of soda was much smaller.
7067,Just bring the standard and service levels up.
7068,I would have liked ice tea available.
7069,Would like to be able to use credit card/debit.
7070,Maybe a snack.
7071,More variety or options.
7072,If only United would offer something other than traditional breakfast food on morning flights. There was a time when you could get a deli plate rather than gross eggs or french toast. Please….
7073,it would be nice to have a choice of the bagette and or pretzels which I did not see offered.
7074,More variety in snacks.
7075,The food was really good but it would have been nice to have more breakfast options.
7076,No.
7077,Café con leche. Chocolate.
7078,I know its hard to do a pre-made breakfast. I think getting back to basics like cereal or basic eggs would be best. Trying to put fancy sauce on eggs etc. is hard to love.
7079,About the foods they served in cold instead of hot or warm.
7080,Iced tea would be a good offering.
7081,No it was nice to get a drink on such a short flight.
7082,More snack options would have been great between the meals. The quiche for breakfast was underwhelming. The texture was very cardboardy.
7083,I would have enjoyed nuts or pretzels with my soda.
7084,I never received a survey for my Denver to Louisville flight. I sat in first class. the meal options were equivalent to something I would get at a gas station. Drink service continues to be problematic as flight attendants do not offer a drink until well into your flight. This has been consistent over my last several flights.
7085,"Not one real meal on an international flight, with dinner time falling in the middle, is rather stingy, I think, even by today's standards."
7086,There could have been a snack offered.
7087,The dinner was ok. The breakfast was horrible.
7088,"Nobody gets on a plane with high expectations of the food. However I have experienced some very nice meals on other airlines. I have flown with United enough now to not expect anything beyond something edible. The quality though has degraded over the years. The old ice cream sundae is long one and replaced by something with the same name, but is far inferior. The breakfast options no longer exist and it is now just some random mix of egg and whatever is handy. The gin & tonic's though are not bad, although it is difficult to mess them up."
7089,y'all could offer more than one darn cookie on a 3.5 hour flight please.
7090,With the limitations of air travel it is a good thing to have drink and snack provided. Thank you. A simple menu of a very limited items that the guest requests from a menu at boarding. Collection of selected menus could be done during preflight. Giving the Attendants time to ready what they need then delivering the requests to those who do indeed want them. Instead of walking a cart up and down the isle. Time saver and possibly space saving.
7091,Wish there was a complimentary snack.
7092,should have been a free snack option along with the free beverage.
7093,No.
7094,I just hope they can give us a little more than pretzels or biscotti! <😊>.
7095,"No, I want to complain about EWR to TLV."
7096,The complimentary snack selection was different from other airlines and so yummy!.
7097,"It was not the food, it was that you guys do not enough Meat plates."
7098,I was disappointed that I could not get an entire can.
7099,Beverages were good.
7100,Coffee not served with meal. Had to ask for it.
7101,Please do not send me a preflight email to select a meal when there is only one option available.
7102,"Love that you have coke, absolutely hate Pepsi."
7103,"The chicken was approaching being overdone, but it was still tasty. I am not a fan of the ""Beyond Meat"" and would not care if it was never offered. I want the real deal."
7104,I appreciated getting the whole can.
7105,Increase variety and portion.
7106,no.
7107,"Start providing complimentary snack of SOME sort on flights, even if shorter."
7108,All food served at the correct temperature and in-flight meals were delicious. I had the short rib dinner and the quiche for breakfast.
7109,I liked the AHA sparkling water. That was a pleasant surprise.
7110,"for a 3.5 hr flight, i feel there should have been a second offering of at least drink and maybe a snack."
7111,Fresh.
7112,no.
7113,No.
7114,Can you please seeve a drink on the flight from Monterey to LAX.
7115,Nothing to be added.
7116,Thanks for the whole can.
7117,Variety of teas.
7118,"the hot snack service at the end of the flight was great, but for a 9 hour long daytime flight there needs to be 2 snack services as we were starving. The lunch was great but of course a small serving."
7119,No.
7120,They ran out of food choices again!. Certain items always go fast so be prepared to have enough especially in business class. My dish was very good!.
7121,Good.
7122,I had great experience. Only feedback that I can think of: It would be great to include vegetarian options in meal.
7123,No.
7124,Great Flight Attendants.
7125,the food in economy premium was below expectations. the selection in regular economy was more appetizing.
7126,maybe change lunch menu same as i had in july.
7127,One pass of beverages on the 4 plus hour flight. People were getting up to go in the rear for more water. I did and noticed others.
7128,It would be nice to have fruit as a dessert option.
7129,Add kettle cooked potato chips.
7130,N/A.
7131,I was thinking thankful drinks were offered.
7132,Variety of food should be more.
7133,Good.
7134,It was minimal.
7135,"Just received a sandwich after eight hours of flight, should have been a fulleal."
7136,Would be nice if you had Dr Pepper.
7137,Would have liked more choices.
7138,I was happy they offered complimentary snacks!.
7139,"If the snakes can have the choice with nuts or non-nuts, that will be really great."
7140,Thanks.
7141,All ok.
7142,Mayor quantity.
7143,Would like Dr Pepper and iced tea.
7144,No.
7145,I could have brought my own food from outside that would have been as good or better than the selection offered by UAL.
7146,The food was above average on all 4 flights. However is was still not in the same league as American or Delta business or frist. The lounge food experience in Polaris was excellent.
7147,They did not have any more vegetarian meals left. Some people were only able to eat chips. The flight was not full.
7148,Please include snacks such as protein bars that are low in sugar or snacks that are low in sodium. Please include beverages such as milk or coconut water that are more dietetic friendly.
7149,Good generally not of good taste and portions are very small.
7150,They had no record of our pre ordered boxes.
7151,"I have been flying Back home a lot in first class. you keep having the same food, chicken and quino and big meatball. It gets old change up the food choices!!!!!!. At least every month!!."
7152,"The vegetarian and vegan menus do not contain adequate protein sources. These menus should be served with appropriate plant or dairy-based protein sources such as but not limited to: tofu and other soy derivatives, pulses, beans;. for vegetarians: all of the above plus portions of cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, etc."
7153,Na.
7154,Loved the on board service.
7155,chicken way too spicy (hot).
7156,Not at all.
7157,"$1 charge on my credit card to register it for in-flight purchases, really?. I am a long-standing UA rewards member and have a United Explorer Mileage Plus Visa to the tune of $3,000-$4,000 per month. Why should I be charged to register my credit card?. Ridiculous."
7158,More craft beer.
7159,The dinner served in first class was really good.
7160,Milk seemed in short supply.
7161,"For a 1 hour 45 minute trip, First ClaSS SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE SNACKOPTIONS."
7162,I want with ice. I did not get.
7163,"Again, I was not awakened when breakfast was served, thus missed the food, coffee, and water."
7164,Selection was two items. Fisrt was a pretend meat and the second was a chicken dish with a rice type combination. The chicken was dry. the cuscus was too spicy.
7165,You should serve chips.
7166,None.
7167,No.
7168,no.
7169,No.
7170,No.
7171,One red wine choice (and not my favorite varietal) was a bit of a letdown. Also having more than one hot item to purchase would have been welcome. (I did enjoy the burger though!).
7172,I would like to change your snacks.
7173,No.
7174,Add more healthy snacks.
7175,Nothing was served due to the weather.
7176,no.
7177,"I would have loved to have cereal for breakfast, but it was not available."
7178,would not it be nice to offer several things. It is pure sugar in pretzels and cookies. Nuts that are not stale?. Licorice?. Sugar but more interesting than cookies.
7179,Serve better wine!.
7180,A white wine that is not chardonnay and I probably would have ordered another.
7181,From Munich to Newark the food was disgusting.
7182,Meatballs were a bit dry and broccolini difficult to cut.
7183,Chicken way to spicy but the rest was ok.
7184,Quality of the food in business class could be improved.
7185,Sehr gut kompliment.
7186,the pasta option was ok. the sandwich (snack) option did not have a vegetarian option left unfortunately.
7187,No I drank water only.
7188,We received a complimentary first class upgrade that we are very grateful to receive. However the chicken in the meal entree was practically inedible and was the least appetizing first/business class meal I have ever had.
7189,I am like before they will bring the food n.
7190,Great!!.
7191,"The dinner smelled delicious, everyone around me seemed to enjoy it."
7192,Meal and sandwich. Very tasty and filling.
7193,for a long flight-4 hours it would be nice to be offered more than two cookes.
7194,Food was much better on the way London to Newark versus Newark to London. It could be a little heathier though. For example salad/ veggies without oil (or on the side) and better cheeses (and with bread versus crackers).
7195,5.5 hour flight - after breakfast no other snack mid flight was offered.
7196,"For the cheese and cracker dessert plate, there should be more crackers. Given the amount of cheese provided, more crackers are needed to balance it out. Better options for the bourbon and whiskey would be appreciated. For the business class passengers it would be nice to have options that are at a mid-tier range as opposed to bottom of the shelf options."
7197,I prefer the old days when a meal was provided.
7198,"Been able to offer more variety of meals. Also be more open to sale food to cash travelers, remembered not everybody is in technology or at least take cc at the spot."
7199,Please offer iced coffee as a beverage option.
7200,Food quality is not as good as it [Food quality] used to be.
7201,The ice creme dessert was frozen solid and they told me to wait for it to defrost.
7202,The meal portion was very small. only one full meal was served during a 11.5-hour flight with snacks and a small sandwich. Plus I was not able to get any food at the airport due to the slow check-in. I was very hungry and had stomachache when we finally landed.
7203,For a five hour flight a meal would be nice. even if its just a sandwich.
7204,Not offered short flight.
7205,Flight crew was friendly and efficient.
7206,none.
7207,In my opinion if I am paying over 400$. the airline should provide more options and better snacks.
7208,Food while healthy not very substantial as far as type of food served. Had a chicken dish with virtually no chicken.
7209,"No snacks offered, even in first class."
7210,Small bottles of water rather than cups poured.
7211,Pretty sketchy for first class.
7212,The short rib meal was one of the best I have had in Polaris. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole meal. I appreciate that you are returning to the level of service that you began when Polaris was rolled out.
7213,"As noted before I selected an entree(flew first class) and selected beef, only to be told 15 minutes later to select something else because the beef entree went to more frequent flyers (1K)."
7214,Should serve a softer bread. Might be better if food is served warm.
7215,Since I did not have your complimentary food or beverage I can not grade.
7216,Food in general has fallen off after COVID.
7217,I love Stromwafles!.
7218,"I was on United Express. the only option was a prepackaged cheese tray. The pie in the sky was good, though."
7219,Sandwich was terrible. Everything else ok.
7220,My complaint is the pre-order feature. I received an email two days before telling me it was time to pre-order. Then the feature did not work. I called and was told to try it within 24 hours of the flight. I tried. It did not work.
7221,Need more selections to order from.
7222,"My son has allergies to nuts. the food served , the steward could not advise if any of the foods contained nuts."
7223,This flight was the only flight they provided snacks on any of the four flights. Which I normally thought they provide some sort of snack and beverage most of our flights it was expected you purchase food and snacks through app.
7224,Very nice dinner.
7225,"I added my card to the app, but it was not clear if I was supposed to preorder and the while in flight the app was not any more clear about the process on how to purchase food."
7226,Nothing served.
7227,Wine selection has gotten better. Would love a few more options though!.
7228,"There was no complementary snack (nuts, etc)."
7229,"There was no food/snack offered. Also, my first choice of drink, tomato juice was ""out"". Also, there was no ice. I heard from another passenger who asked for coffee, that there was no coffee."
7230,I mentioned in the prior comment about the great quality of the gluten free meal! <8)>.
7231,Kosher wine was great. Surprisingly there was no Scotch on the plane.
7232,NOTHING.
7233,Would prefer real food on a longer flight.
7234,did not have it...short flight.
7235,Better choice of beer.
7236,shocked and amazed that i was offered Buffalo Trace for bourbon. That was amazing and a great surprise. I would probably make that a deciding factor if the choice is close to fly United or another comparable carrier. Impressive (to me).
7237,Everything was good.
7238,Would have preferred 3 options instead of 2. The guava?. cake dessert was good. the roll was very hard. The white wine from Australia was very sharp/acidic tasting. Service was excellent.
7239,Very good selection of free beverages.
7240,More than expected.
7241,Why no hot cocoa?.
7242,no.
7243,"Food and beverage was in general OK, only the desert was not what i would try again (but this is my personal preference). What i was missing: at other airlines. there is usually a kind of snack bar at the tail of the airplane, where you can help yourself during the flight with small chocolate bars, chips, etc. , and some drinks (Coke, Water, etc.). This is not (anymore?). the case at UA. Unfortunately. Especially as the size of the main meal is not really filling an adult human and the second service is only a snack (i do not want to call it a meal)."
7244,You guys should offer better free snack. Tickets are too expensive.
7245,No beverages were served in flight.
7246,No.
7247,"Loved having the water, orange juice, champagne offering before the flight. Have missed it during the Covid years. Especially loved having a glass glass for the drink once the plane was in the air. The flight was only one hour. no snacks/meals were offered. It would have been nice to have been offered a bag of peanuts to with the Gin & Tonic...."
7248,No.
7249,N/A.
7250,I always ask for the premium wine. Some employees are going to go to first class and tell me that other say they can not do that. I do not understand why they can not. I am willing to pay the higher price.
7251,"Too little water provided, instead of providing the can, they only gave us a cup."
7252,It is a long flight. A meal would have been more appropriate. Also a bottle of water should be distributed to each passenger. I got a full can of coke with the meal. Had I asked for water it is this little cup.
7253,Yes.
7254,I fly a lot. being offered the same meal choice over and over is disappointing.
7255,"We were not offered any beverage other than water for this trip, despite being offered everything on my Flint to Chicago trip."
7256,No.
7257,Need a larger selection on a medium duration flight.
7258,Very short flight so no time for service.
7259,Actually about connecting flight to FRA.... maybe too much food?. Three meals in ten hours is a lot.
7260,The coffee was Luke warm should be hotter and should offer creamers not only milk.
7261,Ice cream served for dessert was inedible - it tasted like it was mostly sugar. Sweet taste can be ok. this was inedible.
7262,None.
7263,"add a wider selection of teas to the offer, not only black tea. United's lounges carry a wide selection of herbal/non-caffeinated teas - please add them to the flights."
7264,N/a.
7265,I could eat none of snacks Buddha popcorn. pumpkin seeds would be nice. Cheese stick. All snacks flour based.
7266,"This is Polaris business class. Almost $5,000 ticket. Where did multiple courses, ice cream cart, menus, choices, wines go???."
7267,"cutting cost in flight service is not where you can optimize the profit. At least give sandwiches, if you are not going to provide meal as it used to be."
7268,Would have preferred a salad or sandwich to avoid the meal being over salted and highly seasoned.
7269,I appreciated United having gluten-free meals for me as requested. They were very goid.
7270,I was very appreciative that I did not have to pay for tea and the biscuit.
7271,N/A.
7272,No service.
7273,The pretzels could be packaged in one ounce portions. Half ounce probably costs the vendor just as much and leaves the customer feeling cheated of their great product.
7274,"On a flight that long, the flight attendants should come around more than once to offer snacks or drinks."
7275,"I chose wine with dinner, but would have enjoyed a cup of coffee afterwards. If I had requested it at the time of the meal, it would have been cold. However there was no further beverage cart service later. I did not want to ask an attendant just for myself."
7276,Breakfast was not very good - very mediocre pancakes.
7277,"Additional snack basket with a variety of foods would be nice, as United used to do before."
7278,"My husband was disappoint that no small snack (biscuit, pretzels etc.) was offered. We understand that now on short flights those are no longer offered. It is a small perk we will miss."
7279,Did not order anything.
7280,It is confusing what is available.
7281,"Cherry Coke would have been nice. The final (2ND)meal was a sandwich comprised of bread, cheese, and sliced vegetables was cold, dry, and not very tasty. It was not edible. It was the only choice given, as I am not a vegetarian."
7282,No suggest.
7283,No.
7284,One of Twi breakfast optimis was missing.
7285,No.
7286,We were in the premier plus section. After seatbelt sign went off went to the restroom behind us. Unfortunately the drink service started right away with carts blocking the aisle. Unable to get back to my seat for about 15 min.
7287,snacks arrived promptly.
7288,Because of the short duration of the flight there was no beverage or food service.
7289,Is it possible to offer allergy friendly meals.
7290,thank you for stocking Zero Sugar Coke. Please opt for zero sugar snacks.
7291,Short flight. No time for beverage service.
7292,Pretzels were stale.
7293,I would have liked to be able to order in advance the way I could on my previous flight.
7294,No.
7295,maybe some other choices like granola bars.
7296,It is beyond me that my family and I can sit in first class seats for hours and only be offered water. And even that was a chore for the flight attendants to do.
7297,"It would be nice to get the whole can of drinks. Also, I wanted the waffle, but it was out."
7298,Coffee was unfortunately not available due to the broken machine. Received water and was checked in with several times.
7299,"There were only 2 choices for breakfast, neither sounded appealing, the one I got was mediocre at best. And no snack or dessert offered later in the flight (~4 1/2 hour flight)--this was disappointing."
7300,Short trip so no beverage provided. Other flights provide water on short trips.
7301,Pinot Grigio.
7302,Weird menu.
7303,Ran out of apple juice.
7304,Did not like that you have to download app and add credit card details to make a purchase. Should be able to pay with actual credit card or cash.
7305,No.
7306,Would live to have Spicy tomato juice.
7307,It would have been nice to get pretzels or something to munch on since it was dinnertime.
7308,Change the cookies.
7309,it was ok.
7310,No.
7311,I would like to see additional 0 calorie sodas.
7312,Nothing served.
7313,The drink service came through only once. The beer selection was too limited. Only Stella and Buds were offered.
7314,"The meals are noticeably improved!. In the past, the food has been of poor quality and somewhat boring."
7315,"Salad was weird sweet maybe barley, not good. Last time I had tea (previous flight) it had such a strong coffee taste I quit ordering coffee or tea on flights. Sorbet was melty by the time I finished my meal, but was mango and still good. I miss the very frozen ice cream sandwiches that used to be served sometime after the meal and the oriental cracker mix. just pretzels were available. Too much time between meals, glad I brought our own snacks."
7316,No issues.
7317,It was a very short flight no food served.
7318,Please offer more vegeterian choices.
7319,Need to be more protein.
7320,first class breakfast was smaller portions than expected.
7321,It was fine.
7322,Savoir si elles sont payantes où gratuites.
7323,I am gluten free for medical reasons so could not eat any of the snacks. A gf option would be nice.
7324,How come no food available for purchase.
7325,No.
7326,"I know its a short flight, but with all the delays and waiting, water is just not enough...."
7327,"No paper/salt provided with the meal to add on. Due to the flight length, a snack will be much appreciated 4hours after the dinner."
7328,More soda options. Lemon or lime. And do it faster once flight takes off. Also give some snacks.
7329,Very good food. Hot dishes were indeed hot.
7330,The bread was cold on evening meal. and no bread on breakfast.
7331,Good pop.
7332,Everything was as expected super.
7333,The food has gotten much better than recent flights.
7334,No.
7335,More choices would be nice.
7336,No necesary.
7337,No necesary.
7338,No service Flight too short.
7339,Drink was given (soda was pored for you so only got one cup with ice). no snack was provided. Different.
7340,I should not have to pay for a small bag.
7341,"See if the food department can offer a more varied choice of food , its the same offering on all segments."
7342,It was ok stuff.
7343,Only water was offered for the flight.
7344,I was not happy 1 cookie.
7345,They could not find my preorder right away. I had to ask for both my food and my drink.
7346,"I am not sure why but there was not a beverage service offered on this flight. I do not think it was due to turbulence since the seatbelt sign was off for a good portion of the flight and unless I missed it, there was not an announcement about suspending service. The flight attendants were all very friendly. offered water from a bottle. I was able to get a coffee by walking to the back and asking for one. Just not typical beverage service for this route which I fly frequently. Otherwise a great experience as always!."
7347,Snacks are mediocre.
7348,No.
7349,Food temperature was warm not hot. The utensils were extremely cold as if they came out of a freezer.
7350,Please consider offering the bistro options on your shorter flights via Denver because the airport experience is so terrible most of us can not get food in the airport due to horrendously long lines.
7351,Plenty of food and thrinks.
7352,Chicken was not appealing to me. Rice was overcooked. i know hard when preheating a meal.
7353,I would have liked a pre departure beverage while in first class.
7354,No time for drinks.
7355,No food or beverage avail.
7356,I would like to see a return to free snacks and meal service in economy and economy plus.
7357,If we pay all this money we need something special not soda.
7358,I know it is a short flight. coming through with water and cups would have been nice.
7359,would liked to have had a mid morning snack in my first class seat.
7360,Where is my Biscotti?. Lol.
7361,Need better wine choi.
7362,Both entrees contained curry.
7363,The taste of the meal was mediocre. It was properly served and looked reasonably good. the taste was blah.
7364,"Keep doing a good job, with a price we can afford."
7365,prior flight food was great!. this flight was average at best.
7366,"You have cheap, unappealing meal choices on your airlines. Considering I paid $12,500 x 4 for tickets, I would expect edible food, more variety and better quality choices. More snack choices too."
7367,Would liked to have been ‘served’ rather than flagging the flight attendant down each time.
7368,Good coffee on our early morning flight.
7369,I was never offered dessert.
7370,Honey.
7371,Chicken was cold and dry.
7372,"Very good, some temp issue, potatoes not so good, chicken was very good."
7373,"would like to be able to specify condiment preferences such as no mustard, extra catsup, extra butter."
7374,No vegetarian option available. I would have chosen one.
7375,I wanted to buy a drink. you do not have the option unless i had a card and the app. It would be nice to be able to just pay for a drink with my amex.
7376,"Our scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, yogurt, and mimosas were very good."
7377,"The vegetarian option was chilled, when it should have been a room temperature."
7378,I wish there had been a few more options or even a kids snack box.
7379,"Able to get service in twice which was appreciated, and enjoyed the flavored soda waters!."
7380,Would really be nice to have a snack provided especially on longer flights and when having to make connecting flights quickly.
7381,The bread was xold and hard.
7382,I was very impressed that United had Buffalo Trace available. It was amazing!. I try to always buy buffalo trace if I can find it [trace].
7383,It is good.
7384,Improve the menu.
7385,free snacks on extended delays.
7386,Please can you have meal options that do not have same vegetable components ie peppers in both options in case of allergies.
7387,It was very good both dinner and breakfast. The snack baskets were poor selection.
7388,The food trays are too small for the items placed inside the tray. If you were too add 2” to the width it will create more space to place beverages.
7389,"Did not have the meal, trying to catch up on sleep. Did have mixed nuts and coffee and cookies near the end of flight."
7390,Did not take food/beverage.
7391,I problem s.
7392,Lots of hoopla for a Diet Coke and snack.
7393,Excellent food. Was surprised.
7394,I preordered and the flight attendants did not seem to know that I had.
7395,Lack of choices.
7396,Pillow and blanket.
7397,No.
7398,I was not offered an option for my sandwich but heard the flight attendant in the next aisle offering a choice.
7399,More variety.
7400,I would like to see real ice cream sundaes come back in Business.
7401,Would like a different white wine option.
7402,The chicken entrée was very delicious.
7403,not at this time.
7404,Very short flight.
7405,no.
7406,None.
7407,It was the one good thing on the flight.
7408,Turkey/cheese sandwich on a pretzel bun was surprisingly good.
7409,No food and/or beverages were served.
7410,Considero que deberían acompañar la bebida con alguna porción de refrigerio.
7411,Nice to receive full cans!.
7412,No.
7413,"I am not sure what is meant by a complimentary meal. We did receive a dinner & a breakfast snack on a 9 1/2 hour flight. which was included in the Price of our ticket, otherwise, there was no complimentary food offered."
7414,none were offered.
7415,Food needs to upgraded.
7416,Coffee was hot!. Love it that way!.
7417,I was a little disappointed with the variety in first class. I thought there’d be more food choices.
7418,Wish y'all would have a small bag of pretzels or snack at no charge!.
7419,"nope. SF to LAX really has no food service. Business class only gives out crakers, which is fine with me."
7420,The portion of the snack is too small for a 4 hours flight.
7421,The box does not come with a knife or spoon to scoop or spread the cheese... I find this odd. I had to ask the attendant for a stir stick of all things.
7422,N/a.
7423,Prefer Hot Entrée Choice ie such as Breakfast Sandwich etc.
7424,None.
7425,Diet Dr Pepper would be great.
7426,1st flight last 2 times does not offer snacks free so that has been disappointing and diminishes my feeling about united.
7427,Not worth mentioning my bit of frustration in first row of EconPlus.
7428,A very nice selection to choose from. having a sparkling wine before takeoff was a welcome touch.
7429,"I am eager to see United return to full service of meals . . .serving food in courses, bringing back the dessert cart. It is just not the same. It feels rushed and is just not as tasty as prepandemic."
7430,Bigger portions please.
7431,The inflight meal I had preset was not at all enjoyable unfortunately.
7432,The meal was awful!.
7433,Need to change the snacks.
7434,"If possible, add an extra snack."
7435,No - my husband is a vegan and there really are not that many options for him.
7436,No.
7437,There is only Diet Coke no diet sprite or ginger ale Free snacks ok.
7438,Simply the meat have to be prepared in Europe ….
7439,Will there be a time when more real food offerings will be offered on long flights for purchase instead of just snack boxes?.
7440,Would have liked the opportunity to purchase a beverage or to have had coffee available.
7441,Keep doing what your doing it works.
7442,the idea of serving cold dinner meal does not work.
7443,no.
7444,It would be nice to get a snack with the glass of champagne.
7445,I was pleased with the meal plus snacks delivered during the flight. Much more than I have gotten on other flights. Helped make the flight go quicker.
7446,Pretzels were stale.
7447,Chicken is usually tough & hard to eat so I always get pasta so be sure to keep it on menu.
7448,I did not take any food/beverages (so tired).
7449,It would be nice if the app and/or website showed food options prior to the flights.
7450,Expected a better snack selection in first class. Snacks were same as those offered in economy.
7451,Why no cheese and fruit tray?.
7452,The flight ran out of options for first class passengers. my first selection was not available. I ended up eating a snack pack for dinner.
7453,Sprite was flat.
7454,The food was OK for an economy class flight. the white wine was UNDRINKABLE!!. It was really terrible.
7455,None because because everything is good.
7456,No.
7457,Na.
7458,I was first class and they offered no meal or snacks only beverages that was disappointing.
7459,I appreciate the snack boxes being available.
7460,Absolutely ridiculous that we do not get anything for a snack for the price we paid. Sometimes we traveled in first class…just give a sandwich and salad.. nothing fancy.
7461,No.
7462,Wine should be complimentary in first class.
7463,No more snacks bad publicity!.
7464,The hamburger before landing was awful.
7465,The chicken was very dry. I was suprised that nothing was offered nearer to the end of the flight. A small snack or something. I expected that in a 4.5 hour redeye flight in 1st class.
7466,YES DEFINITELY SHOULD PROVIDE A MEAL EVEN SANDWICH AND BEVERAGE.
7467,Ran out of the breakfast sandwich which was disappointing you should never run out you are better off having a couple left over then running out.
7468,I love that United added AHA sparkling water.
7469,Healthy and tasty.
7470,Too much plastic packaging and waste.
7471,Could not serve food due to rocky flight.
7472,Different snack.
7473,No short flight.
7474,There was no food or beverage service on my flight. I have in the past been offered water on this flight which is nice for the short flight.
7475,Wine was ot offered on the international flight.
7476,There was not any but the flight was short.
7477,I am gluten free. there really are not good options for me. Especially no free snack. If I order a box i can only eat half the contents. i can not order gluten free food online. have to order separately by a phone call and the person i am speaking with may know what they are doing so my food may not get ordered (when I fly business class). This really could be a much better process.
7478,The flight was more than 9 hours long. We got lunch in the first couple of hours and then for at least 6 hours or so no other snack was provided. These days the portions are so small that it can not last that long (even for a petite person). United should at least provide some options of snack and drink till they serve the next snack an hour before landing.
7479,I would like to be able to order more than one alcoholic beverage at a time.
7480,NA.
7481,Did not have any food or drink.
7482,No.
7483,Very good selections.
7484,"I did not purchase any food. However I would like to see more options available for the snack. Maybe offer 3 options - sweet, salty, healthy."
7485,Chicken entree was too spicy. Fruit cup was great. Bead and butter and cookie were great.
7486,No.
7487,Red wine was delicious.
7488,They ask me if I want lasagna o chicken but I was so tired no hungry thanks.
7489,No.
7490,No.
7491,Aha water very good.
7492,Excellent breakfast fruit tray-very refreshing!.
7493,Snacks were ok . Wish there was a option of purchasing a 5$ ( Mix of snacks) as part of the booking process ..
7494,There is not much variety — even for pre-ordered meals!. It is the same stuff time and time again. And the chocolate muffin dessert thing is so bizarre and undercooked and oily and odd.
7495,Need more food choices.
7496,No.
7497,More wine options.
7498,I think your flight attendants need to do a better job letting passengers know what is available.
7499,No.
7500,In a long flight you can provide two snacks.
7501,no.
7502,"We are happy that the meals are not strictly vegetarian. Also, that you are able to get a drink throughout the flight if you woulf like one. The flight attendants were very courteous."
7503,"I amin forstå class when I fly, hard to complain about anything."
7504,The beef was too dry and bit overdone.
7505,The food on the flight is great. Its the food option in the terminal in Huston and only being able to use a CR code. Not everyone has a smart phone. do they want to give there personal information to order food. Also no way would I tip a server if I never speak or see them.
7506,No.
7507,No.
7508,No.
7509,no.
7510,no.
7511,Bigger dessert menu.
7512,"The cookie was the desert. Very disappointed. A slice of cake or pie would be better. Bring back the Sunday service. Make your own. For that matter, bring back pre over service all together."
7513,Do not change a thing.. Five Stars.
7514,"I noticed they had a vegetarian choice of ""Beyond Meat Balls"" I think that could have been submitted for Mushrooms on the Chicken Orzo meal because the chicken Orzo meal with the lemon pepper sauce was delicious. You could have offered that same meal minus the chicken but add the mushroom for vegetarians. That would have been another option for those that do not eat meat."
7515,No.
7516,Can peanuts or almonds be offered as additional snack choices?. I know people have allergies to such things. biscoff and a carmel filled cookie are BORING and practically tasteless.
7517,Salty Snacks.
7518,a snack would have been appreciated. especially in the hour we waited on board for the weather to pass.
7519,Delicious.
7520,No coffee or tea was offered after the main meal. Other airlines offer this and it is expected. The food service was just one round and done.
7521,Where are the warm biscuits?.
7522,Just drink.
7523,never offered a lunch pak but 2 others next to me enjoyed/.
7524,A bit chintzy for a 7+ hour flight.
7525,Wish there was hot food options.
7526,Was a short flight I did not want anything.
7527,Illy coffee is one of the reason i chose to fly with United airlines.
7528,Excellent whiskey.
7529,No suggestions.
7530,They did not serve anything.
7531,Replace the cookie.
7532,I liked the warm chocolate cookie dessert.
7533,Seems you could include food in price of flight when going for a 4+ hour trip. Would place you above what others do.
7534,Please offer different meal options!!!.
7535,Drinks were nice. Would have been nice to have received a small snack in 1st.
7536,Appreciated pretzels on short flight.
7537,Add a different cookie.
7538,My daughter is allergic to quinoa and it was the main ingredient of the entree. Would have been helpful to know Attendant did offer the other but it was much later when they were cleaning up and wondered why she had not eaten. Do not really know how you avoid these challenges I guess.
7539,Excellent.
7540,Disappointing there was not a preorder option. Rolls were cold. Definitely sub par first class experience.
7541,"United seems to have an issue with serving food that actually tastes and looks good. The plant based food, Indian food and vegetarian food are disgusting. the healthy options are definitely unappealing. I ordered the burger, which was good, but it came with a roll (why do I need a roll when I have a bun with the burger) and tasteless fruit. Why do not you provide sides that actually go with a burger - fries, potato salad, macaroni salad, etc.?."
7542,Pretzels tasted stale. portion size was small.
7543,no.
7544,I am happy that we can pre-order our food. Our outbound flight from LAX to Orlando offered more options. It would be nice to have more than 2 options. The chicken option I pre-ordered was switched-out but it was good. I also noticed that salads are not provided anymore. It would be nice to see salads make a return.
7545,BEER CHOICES COULD BE MORE DOMESTIC. BUT GLAD FOR OFFERINGS.
7546,Limited choice.
7547,Hawaiian chips.
7548,Limited Selection of meal options as the plane was not restocked.
7549,No.
7550,Better breakfast options.
7551,None.
7552,"In my opinion, when the flights are delayed ( for whatever reason) I think there should be better selection of food at no cost ( maybe smaller sandwiches, cheese and crackers…."
7553,"Tofu was the only choice for the meal in 1st class?. Really, I saw others with another food. To run out of the choices in first class is wrong. especially with what I pay to sit in first class."
7554,"I was surprised a snack, bag of pretzels, etc, was not provided on either flight."
7555,None.
7556,Food is fine. some of the options are so specific- some additional sandwiches. burgers would be great - or just a nice salad.
7557,Complimentary snacks.
7558,"What is with the no chips or pretzals?. Yeah, very minor issue there<:)>."
7559,"My seat, was not able to reclining. No charge to cellphone in cabin."
7560,Snacks and fruit offerings are much worse than prepandemic.
7561,"If one pre-orders special meals specifically, I like to think the special meals are expected to be served. The flight attendants just brushed it off as I DID NOT CONFIRM it after I pre-ordered them. It is in my profile as well. They told me that another lady needed it without pre-ordering, so it was given away."
7562,"While overcooked a bit, the pasta option was delicious!. I would just suggest that the flight attendants provide a better description of the options more than just “chicken or pasta”. My wife would have chosen the pasta too if she knew what sauce it came with."
7563,I used to get at least pretzel. nothing offered. We got pretzel while going to Chicago from memphis.
7564,It was a good value and met my needs.
7565,Red wine was just ok. I would pay more for a better wine.
7566,The cheeseburger bun was rock hard.
7567,"Dinner was very good, much better than expected. The only thing missing was some type of dressing for the salad."
7568,Fine. No issues.
7569,The coffee was great.
7570,You need to make sure you have enough food selection for people in 1st class before offering for purchase to the rest of the passengers. I wanted the waffle. there was not enough for 1st class passengers. so we did not get options.
7571,Maybe a couple more snack options would be nice.
7572,The original burger was frozen. A new one was provided. Monica and her team were a pleasure and made it all work. Can you please get more Gluten free options!.
7573,My default credit card is my company card. I do not want to charge alcohol to that card. Whenever I try to use bar codes for other cards or PayPal internet does not work and bar code goes away. Consider applepay or another way to contactless pay with secondary card that does not depend on internet. Or improve internet connection.
7574,more options should be available. The 'Dinner' menu is not really something I would call 'meal'. It was more like 'snack' than 'meal'.
7575,Much better than the weird spinach flan offered on my recent SFO FRA flight.
7576,More variety of snacks would be great.
7577,"Some indication that quantities were limited, even in advance ordering, would have been helpful."
7578,I drink iced tea of the time. only hot tea was available with ice available.
7579,food delivery could have been better handled.
7580,The food was ok. I do not think that is good enough for first class!.
7581,More options or being told about the snack would be good. I am allergic to dairy so some things I can not eat.
7582,My husband asked for 2 snacks and was told there was not enough onboard to give him two.
7583,I did not get a snack. nothing was offered.
7584,"Same as before, variety of options for different tastes and requirements would be good."
7585,N/A.
7586,There should have been dessert and there should be nondairy options like soy or oat milk for tea and coffee.
7587,flight was too short to serve.
7588,Should have ability to use a credit card on the flight…NOT be limited to contactless pre flight.
7589,"Did not know it was impossible to pay with card during the flight, paid cash to a guy that ordered for us."
7590,I would like more healthy options.
7591,nope.
7592,I was ok.
7593,It is ridiculous that you want us to buy snacks when we paid for the plane tickets and per seat picked.
7594,Better food than other companies.
7595,The flight attendants should have come around a 2nd time with water.
7596,Better options for snacks and more individual healthy snacks for sale would be nice.
7597,"some snacks, or a cake."
7598,I appreciate that they served the whole can of soda.
7599,Did not purchase a snack box because the choices were not very good.
7600,It would be nice to have a small snack like pretzels or cookies that did not cost.
7601,Give me the whole can of Coke please.
7602,No.
7603,Please see comments in first item.
7604,The chicken dinners are way too dry and unappealing.
7605,No.
7606,I was happy to receive a whole can of juice.
7607,Appreciated on this trip that I was offered the whole can of soda rather than just the 4 oz cup.
7608,Too expensive for alcohol.
7609,"I might would ask if milk were available. I did not this time. I drink only milk, water, or healthy juices."
7610,Not today.
7611,Coffee was high quality.
7612,"Comparing the meal to what meals used to be on the plane, it was a little disappointing. What I did not like was that the sendwich before landing was served cold."
7613,Nice !.
7614,Seems like economy “plus” should include a beverage - Delta does - food and a little bottle seemed spendy.
7615,No.
7616,We have been on several flights recently and the two choices available have been the same on all four if those flights. Need more variety!.
7617,I would like you all to begin serving premium wine for sale in main cabin again please. Especially on the longer flights!.
7618,While this leg of our journey the quality of food was excellent the experience on our preceding leg from LHR to LAX was not of a similar standard.
7619,its the best !!!.
7620,No vegan option.
7621,"Short flight, no food or beverage served."
7622,Beer and wine.
7623,"While not on this flight. If you are going to offer to preorder a meal, it seems to me that all of the options should be available. I can not understand why any selection would be unavailable during preorder. I thought this was the idea of preordering?. If it is 2-3 days out from the departure day, that seems like plenty of time to get all of the preorders on the plane. This needs to be fixed."
7624,Somehow my Kosher requirements in my profile did not occur on the flight manifest and the crew had to get me a Kosher meal as the plane was boarding.
7625,I was impressed with the preorder options. I was happy with the taste of the food. I understand that food tastes differently at altitude and it still tasted good.
7626,Na.
7627,All good.
7628,The snack boxes are great.
7629,need better choices for vegans such as de-cafe coffee and soy milk. also need better healthier vegan snacks. main meals were ok. apple juice and soda water would be nice.
7630,The food was spilled on the tray the flight attendant gave the wrong tray at first...and when he brought the correct one it was 1/2 spilled on the serving napkin... and tasted just ok.
7631,Decaf coffee should be kept on the beverage cart so flight attendants do not need to run to the back of the plane to obtain it.
7632,I enjoy the convenience of ordering snacks and having them billed to me in a contactless manner because I preloaded a payment method to my United Airlines app wallet.
7633,Enjoy the AHA flavored sparkling water.
7634,N.
7635,I believe more of a snack option. I felt pressured to only pick one when I had not eaten all day and could have really used both.
7636,There was no service due to the very short duration of the flight.
7637,It is important to offer something more than the snacks. It is a 4.45 minutes flight.
7638,No.
7639,Give different options with less sodium and better flavor/ taste.
7640,Please add another main option for vegetarians!!. You have a burger;. add an impossible burger. Especially true for flights to / from SFO.
7641,No.
7642,"No, it was fine."
7643,Small package of snack.
7644,they didn't offer me cookies or pretzels <:(>.
7645,No free snack options anymore.
7646,There was no Apple juice.
7647,No.
7648,"On all United flights, please serve the stroopwaffle every time. I will be flying Boston to Newark and then to Orlando next month."
7649,No.
7650,no very good.
7651,I hate the move to pre-flight ordering. I do not know then!. Please do not take away inflight choice.
7652,"I did not like that I could not buy food without the app. I am not tech savvy. There are other ways to buy things without cash or card. Venmo, touch-less using your phone. I did like that we received the complimentary snacks. I was nauseous. the pretzels and ginger ale helped. Thank you."
7653,No.
7654,Coffee is good and hot!.
7655,The chiken a little spice .
7656,I think salty is better than sugar.
7657,Please Add This trajectory to my status.
7658,Only lukewarm and only meat options.
7659,It is ok because is a short flight.
7660,Would be great to have more variety of snacks other than Biscoff and pretzels. Did appreciate being handed both. A more nutritious option would be nice.
7661,"The hot food was, indeed, hot!. And the flight attendant removed the foil covering before handing us the food--very good!."
7662,Paid for a First Class ticket and received Economy Plus service!!!.
7663,A full can!!!. Yay!.
7664,"I have noticed that the snacks are usually very mundane on the trips to Lagos , whilst internal flights have a better variety."
7665,I wish you would offer Iced Tea on flights. It is an easy go-to beverage for me normally (especially when trying to watch weight). I do appreciate the flavored sparkling water offered now.
7666,No food service between Montrose and Denver. Great breakfast between Denver and Cincinnati!. The scrambled eggs and ham were great. the oatmeal was delicious.
7667,Delicious.
7668,Please give better free snacks.
7669,Please offer herbal tea.
7670,A cheese tray for first class. Your cheaping out on me for what you charge.
7671,"This is a comment about food service in general... UA has been slow to recover post-COVID compared to AA. This is regarding both food options, presentation, and courses of service."
7672,Brought my own.
7673,Great.
7674,I wish there were more fresh options. Especially on flights that get require early morning arrival.
7675,Please note on the options if the selection is gluten free.
7676,They ran out of Sprite and Coke. It is not that hard to have extras of these.
7677,there were NO snacks served with the beverage. At least they could offer peanuts or chips???.
7678,I think economy plus should receive a bit more care in the form of food and beverage without having to pay.
7679,No food or beverage was served on this flight. I understand it is a short flight. a water or cracker would had been nice.
7680,Short flight had time for 1 drink and everything was good.
7681,Would for you to add better tea. Plus I did not get a snack. Not sure if that is not always a thing.
7682,no.
7683,Its fine.
7684,The staff/ crew members came up with a few items like salad and fruit which helped with not going without some food during the flight which was commendable.
7685,"No, food was good. And hot."
7686,"Tasty meal, pleasantly served."
7687,Very few snack options. I would like to see a few more. Our flight was two hours. 20 minutes only snack boxes and a few snacks are available. A sandwich would have been nice.
7688,There should be more food options other than snacks like chips and nuts.
7689,None.
7690,No food or beverages were served.
7691,Breakfast snack was very disappointing. Only a small yogurt and a sugary breadstick.
7692,I was given a snack box.
7693,no.
7694,"It is such a short flight, barely time to enjoy anything."
7695,"Breakfast options limited;. flight time was late enough, and long enough, to have lunch option."
7696,Need a better selection.
7697,"No tea or coffee served on the breakfast before landing. I guess it was due to air turbulence so safety was considered (hot beverages), yet no one mentioned to present this explanation. Additionally, nothing else but water was served. Not even any type of juice, which is disappointing as it is not hot , no safety issue, and it is clearly one of the favorite drinks during breakfast. Mainly of you travel with kids."
7698,"Food out of Munich much better than on the flight out of Houston, better vegan option."
7699,Food not great. drinks were good.
7700,"On the app, the flight details says there will be dinner (business/first class). there was not."
7701,No.
7702,I did not know what was complimentary vs what I needed was to pay for. I was not told that there was a menu you could order off of which was a bit disappointing.
7703,"I clicked on the wrong item back there. I have noticed that the meals on flights returning from the UK are often far better quality and have nice UK style touches. I do wish the US to UK flights had less processed and low quality ingredients. I had a very nice chicken piri piri on this flight that was tasty, hot, and different. The wheatberry salad was unusual and healthy. Roll was tasty. The yogurt was from a UK company and was good but a bit artificial tasting, unfortunately. Tea was so so;. far too weak, I am afraid. Arrival snack was hot pocket style. needed after such a long flight and a continued journey with a tight layover."
7704,No.
7705,The hot tea is really awful and must be instant. I could not drink it unfortunately.
7706,I think small bottled water would be nice instead of cups.
7707,the coffee cup was not cleared from the exterior and had a crack. do not the folks even check the cleanliness?.
7708,Unique to have chicken katsu with curry sauce. It was delicious and refreshingly different. A bit too much rice served on the flight though.
7709,Very starchy.
7710,overhead. A snack without sugar. Only offered cookies or waffles.
7711,There was not any alcohol available. Not a big deal but would like to have a cold beer.
7712,The pancakes that were served for breakfast were like none I have ever eaten. They were hard and very dry. They were cold. Dinner was fine. breakfast was terrible!.
7713,"In economy plus section, we normally get free beverage and a free bag of biscuit or waffle. This time, we only get beverage."
7714,It was nice to have pretzels and not the tasteless small bread sticks.
7715,No.
7716,flight attendant was above exceptional!. she made our flight even more enjoyable!.
7717,nothing.
7718,The survey asks what snack you chose. no choice was provided. the snack received was not any of the choices indicated on the survey. I was surprised to see that only beer. wine were complimentary. usually other alcohols are also complimentary on transatlantic flights. The sandwich/baguette served prior to landing was very tasty;. a surprisingly good snack.
7719,It is nice when I request a Coke or a Cranberry Juice that I receive a cup with ice and are offered the ENTIRE 12-oz can of this beverage. Far too many times I only got 3-oz portion poured into the cup with the remaining 9-oz can put back in the beverage cart to be split between three other passengers. Please provide the whole can.
7720,Good.
7721,Love the biscoff cookies and they are vegan which I am.
7722,Most do not like cold Oatmeal or cold chia entrees The croissant is so dry you need a glass of water. The cheese tray good. Just serve hard boiled eggs cheese fruit A croissant is good but change vendors.
7723,My son purchased me the snack pack. I am so happy because all the snacks are so good.
7724,The chicken was dry. the orzo was good.
7725,None.
7726,I think that you should have more snacks even if it is for purchase available during the flight for those that can not pre order food.
7727,Just curious as to why a meal is not provided for this flight.
7728,"No snacks, unless I was supposed to ask or pay for them?."
7729,I would like to have diet dr. pepper.
7730,"Food choice options were poor. While I enjoyed the meal, I was apprehensive beforehand because you served food that I was not familiar with."
7731,"The chicken dish was too spicy, and there had been no warning that it [warning] was prepared in a spicy way. I also had some of the pasta option (shared with my husband), and it was too salty."
7732,I am glad they still have ginger ale. Though I am still unhappy about the lack of complimentary snacks.
7733,"Both to and from CLT had no service. At times when the situaationm is compacted, it would be helpfult o have a flt attendant walk by with cups of water, considering the air in the cabin is dry. I asked for water before landing and got a cup. It felt awkward."
7734,100 persent on everything thank you for all you do.
7735,No cookies or pretzels this flight.
7736,"Apparently they had run out of the scotch whiskey preferred. Drank Cutty Sark, very ""Old Style brand""... it was just ok."
7737,No chips or cookies were offered.
7738,No.
7739,wish have to have more drink.
7740,No.
7741,We were not offered a small snack.
7742,All good..... no.
7743,Limited options for vegetarians and served late in second leg.
7744,"I did not get a snack because I was out of my seat and was in the toilet. In the past, they would have left it at my seat."
7745,My husband has celiacs. There are never snacks that he can eat. Sometimes there is nothing he can buy. I would prefer a fruit based snack to cookies or pretzels.
7746,The pork entree was not great. And the arrival snack burger could use a refresh.
7747,"You should make the Spinach and Kale pastry available on all flights. Additionally, you should ensure more customers pre-order so they can select the option they want."
7748,"Fresh, complementary, my children ordered additional snacks and drinks, very efficient and delicious."
7749,love to have peanuts for snack as more filling but understand some passengers may be allergic to peanuts.
7750,"The cookies are good, I love it."
7751,Coffee was warm and bitter.
7752,"Received 2nd choice of entree, which was not really preferred."
7753,"It was disappointing that the flight only offered snacks even though it was at dinner time. This was exacerbated by a strike in SFO which limited food availability, and a very short connection due to an unexpected landing in Eugene (medical emergency). Thus no time to purchase any food in SFO."
7754,it is ok.
7755,I wish you would carry a non-dairy creamer for coffee.
7756,"The burger offered, for the second meal, was awful."
7757,Would recommend some liquor to be added.
7758,"Please have more choices for the entire and I am tired of eating sicken in Marinara sauce with spinach and Orzo. The vegetarian meatballs were okay but the green broccolini that was served with it was too bitter and chewy. Broccoli would be preferred instead of broccoli. Also for choices wud prefer a Cheese Platter with variety of cheeses, crackers and grapes for fruit."
7759,No.
7760,I tried to login. pre purchase food for this flight and all items were sold out within 45 minutes of the email. Then there was very limited options available by the time the flight crew got to me. That was a bit disappointing on a late cross country flight.
7761,Need better choices for snacks.
7762,"Surprised that on a flight to Hawaii no Mai Tai's were on board to drink. Everything else was fine. if you are going to Hawaii, a Mai Tai on the way seems to be the correct drink to have on board. We used to get them all the time."
7763,No.
7764,Prefer local food.
7765,There was a lot of food. It was very good. service was excellent.
7766,"Nice selection, tasty and plenty."
7767,I accidentally selected yes for the pre-order so I did not pre-order. Subsequently however it was only appropriate for me to say that I got it [pre-order] when you asked me. All things considered the flight was fine. I will definitely fly United again.
7768,No inflight service.
7769,Start serving hot snacks for purchase.
7770,Bring back the cart with Sundaes and Baileys or Cognac or maybe the milk and chocolate chip cookies. I always thought they could be a revenue source… 3 for ?. $ as you conclude your flight.?. Think Mom or . Dadi is home. I brought you COOKIES from United.
7771,Terrible taste.
7772,You should offer children's menus... menus with less prepared dishes... Do not make such strange mixtures of ingredients... Normal food...
7773,I think all is well done.
7774,I am so glad that United has increased the number of choices in Polaris. The chicken tikka masala was delicious. I am Indian.
7775,More healthy choices fresh fruit etc.
7776,Recommend Whole30 options.
7777,The food was very good. There was also a variety of snacks available throughout the flight.
7778,It would be nice to have a normal selection and not try to make it do gourmet. Especially the salad.
7779,It had a good taste and a lot of variety overall.
7780,there was none available.
7781,very good food service.
7782,Went pretty smoothly.
7783,"One beer offered, Stella, was not enough. Provide some craft IPA's."
7784,for a 5 almost 6 hour trip the snacks were provided in the first 20 mins of the flight.
7785,All was perfect.
7786,"When water is offered, I often thought that is all that will be offered without knowing that you can ask for juice!."
7787,The coffee was always call if you do not have requested hot!.
7788,Good snacks.
7789,Charge a little more on Polaris and have finer wines and food.
7790,"The mobile app contactless wallet did not update timely, limiting my ability to purchase drinks at the most opportune time."
7791,My only complaint was by the time they got to me at the end of the plane my ipa choice was gone.
7792,I would have purchased food but could not because I did not have a credit card stored on the app. Cookies were good a healthier option like a trail mix also would be good.
7793,They only had pretzels or cookies to pick from. Pretty limiting. Very strict on needing to order ahead in the app to received paid for purchases. No alcohol available for purchase through app or in person.
7794,"Need more hot food choices, not just snack boxes."
7795,A meal would be nice in a 6 hour flight across the Pacific Ocean to Kauai. Had a similar flight from Newark to Paris and got offered 2 meals.
7796,Meals could be better.
7797,Complimentary meal was included.
7798,Everything was on point.
7799,No snacks (cookie/pretzels) were offered.
7800,Not available.
7801,You always serve yogurt with fruit already included which has large amounts of sugar. I wish you served plain yogurt and the passenger could add real fruit provided.
7802,More variety and quantity.
7803,"I could not buy wine because I did not selected before the fly and they did not take credit cards. Well I was having trouble just getting internet in Panama, this that everything has to be done on line is terrible if you are having problems with wifi."
7804,N/A.
7805,No.
7806,In an international flight UA just served beer and some cheap wine. This is sad. Felt cheated and frustrated.
7807,No.
7808,More meals and snacks on a long haul.
7809,All good.
7810,The snack portions are too small.
7811,The complimentary snakes were cookies and cookies would like at least a pretzel option.
7812,Full soda.
7813,You used to serve French/Spanish wine in economy which I preferred.
7814,There should be more variety of food and snacks.
7815,Asked for Ginger Ale and none was on the plane.
7816,n/a.
7817,Would love to see the dessert cart come back in Polaris.
7818,"Due to turbulence no beverages were served, which was no fault of the airline."
7819,Food (beef) too oily.
7820,Need more variety please.
7821,"The hot meal was surprisingly tasty though the presentation can improve, while it is understandable that ice cream is the only dessert option, alternatives are appreciated. The cold sandwich snack was horrible, with stale bread with barely any filling."
7822,Would have expected a broader variety than two options on a First/Business LA-NY 7am flight.
7823,I need a gluten free option for the First Class main course selection.
7824,It was a long flight. There should have been a complimentary meal served.
7825,I had same food at other flights.
7826,There should be better snack selection in first class especially when flights are during lunch or dinner time when there is not enough time to eat a meal in the airport before the flight. I ate lunch at the Philadelphia airport food court when we got there.
7827,The flight attendants absolutely hate the contactless app that they have to use to serve meals. The app is unreliable. the hand held device has to constantly be refreshed. all this slows their ability to serve customers. I was lucky that I was in row 8. I can not imagine being back in row 30XX and having to wait over an hour just for a beverage!. Best to return to what you did before. Covid is something we will all live with. Food service/packaging does not carry the virus- it spreads in the air!.
7828,The coffee was awful. Could not get it [coffee] down without adding copious amounts of sugar and cream.
7829,Please have gluten Free snack options.
7830,"First class seating was not quite as good as the upgraded version we had in our last flight, but still very good!."
7831,"No small snack as in the past?. Nuts, crackers, etc .. Sure, we can purchase at the airport. no small snack on the plane seems a little cheap."
7832,The food was really tasty. Chicken small salad and roll.
7833,Even though the flight was short I wish they would have handed out some sort of snack.
7834,Beef jerky tasted great. I was disappointed that the packaging was extremely more than necessary. And the amount provided in this larger container was in adequate For the price.
7835,Would be nice if meals for purchase would be offered on flights shorter than 4 hours.
7836,contactless payment by use of the app kept me from buying drinks or food. I prefer a credit card.
7837,Snacks should be available free of charge on the longer flights.
7838,Premium Economy food service has been excellent. More beverage options would be better. overall experience is very good.
7839,Egg whites were great. It was a substitute item but was better than the original item ordered.
7840,Be consistent with snacks and beverages. We should have the same choices and that has not been my experience the last few times that I have flown.
7841,Stroopwaffles are awesome!.
7842,Food and service was great.
7843,Enjoyed a glass of champagne.
7844,"I understand why the use of a credit card is necessary but for those of us older people who do not bank online, use Apple Pay etc etc , it is useless to only offer goods for purchase if I have downloaded the latest United .app . I can not, not enough storage to update it."
7845,the New Delli plate (cold cuts) is disappointing and could be served as an appetizer at best.
7846,No.
7847,Food selection is not very good. Desert is appalling: it is unhealthy and it is so sweet that it is inedible.
7848,First class should offer snack boxes free or something besides pretzels.
7849,"As a customer in Polaris class, I was surprised at not having been offered a drink - neither alcoholic nor soft - until having been in the air for almost an hour and a half. There was a bottle of water in my station, however."
7850,We were not offered anything to eat or snack on in First Class.
7851,It was very nice.
7852,Could do much more flavorful food choices. The fruit salad was nice.
7853,"There are several small packages inside the box. The outside box & inside packages are very difficult to open!. Also, a utensil to spread the cheese or hummus would be nice. This might help in opening the packages."
7854,"The Soba noodle ""salad"" was weird and too cold."
7855,We ordered sodas and were brought watered down drinks in glasses while our neighbors were handed glasses of ice with full cans.
7856,It was a bit watered down with a lot of ice..
7857,Better selection.
7858,Wine glasses not boarded.
7859,Veggie noodle dish gave me stomach ache/stomach gas.
7860,It greatly needs to be improved. The stir fry was terrible.
7861,"Not a huge problem, I just think salty and sweet snacks should be offered at the same time…I feel bad even complaining about this when there are starving people in the world!."
7862,No.
7863,None.
7864,"It was a long flight. In addition to breakfast, something for lunch would have been great. Even a little snack."
7865,Should be fine for the trip. Can not complain hard work on the sky. Safety is the most.
7866,Provide correct menu and offer enough meals based on the menu.
7867,Very tasty.
7868,None.
7869,"Beverage selection in First class is excellent. The food is terrible, and for a 5+ hour flight. a snack should be provided midway."
7870,A bigger snack.
7871,No.
7872,More coffee.
7873,"We did not receive a complimentary snack on the flight. Not the end of the world, but I look forward to it. Greatly appreciate not paying for drinks."
7874,"Your center in Newmarket is great without enough seating. people are taking up seating space after eating without allowing others seating for food or beverages, causing us to leave without either , much to small, not enough seating, present area was much overcrowded."
7875,All good.
7876,Decaf tea would be a welcome addition. Lots of people do not like black tea. Also a salad option would be great.
7877,Na.
7878,"They did not offer free snacks at all. On my flight from EWR to ATL, they offered snacks after drinks were already served. It was pointless by then. They need to be offered at the same time."
7879,"Two products offered in first class for snacks is kind of weak in the market these days. Have some chips, pretzels, breakfast bars, etc. in the basket is more of a first class offering. Separately, hearing ""Stroopwafel"" at cruising altitude in a 737-8 is a word that is tough to understand. I did not try them, they looked good, but I am not a sweets kind of guy."
7880,Decent champagne and OJ.
7881,We flew first class who all was wonderful.
7882,N/A.
7883,Better variety of treats.
7884,Better snacks and beverages to choose from.
7885,Great fly<✈️>.
7886,Good food.
7887,I was often thirsty for water on that long flight. Water should have been offered much more often.
7888,The purchased food options are very limited.
7889,Everything was fresh and tasted really good. Thank you.
7890,no.
7891,"In business class, I think we should be made aware of other food options during the flight like snacks."
7892,Food was average at best with few desirable options for vegetarians.
7893,There must be enough choices.
7894,Quantity is very less.
7895,"Crackers terrible. What about oatmeal raisin , short bread, chocolate chip ?."
7896,I have been eating the same meals on your flights for years. Time to try new items!.
7897,Should have other food options to choose from Thank You.
7898,can offer food choice.
7899,I hesitated to order any wine/champagne on this flight as our flight over from HNL to EWR had inferior champagne upon initial seating. Could not United spend a little bit more in upgrading their brands in liquor?.
7900,Adding a gluten free option might be nice. I did greatly appreciate the meat free options.
7901,"The salad was not appealing. Too many individual parts, without common items. Go simpler."
7902,"Very good, and nice to have."
7903,YOU SHOULD HAVE GOOD SNACKS.
7904,None.
7905,Great.
7906,Flight attendant did not carefully listen to choices presented and handed a wrong drink and quickly moved on before asking.
7907,I think chicken should also be available for non veg passengers.
7908,Salad was strange and seemed to contain some leftover lettuce from a green salad in the oat salad.
7909,Snack offered were not tasteful.
7910,Priority class one small bottle of wine was served;. no cocktails available.
7911,Get better wine.
7912,No it was good enough.
7913,Wine quality not great. Better in lounge. Or on BA.
7914,I ws in Economy Plus. food was pitiful for 1 3 1/2 hour flight.
7915,Having a couple different white and red options would be great in the future.
7916,Impossible meatballs are inedible.
7917,Less sodium.
7918,We should have at least a few choices.
7919,No.
7920,nothing available for purchase on the flight as far as food.
7921,No and the wifi not working.
7922,"They served water in small cups, and did not give us bottles of water before turning the lights down. Definitely not enough water."
7923,"No snack/crackers with drink, that is cheap. Below standard of a major airline."
7924,Thanks for offering the sodas without the plastic cup!!!.
7925,The pre-order is great!. However there was only a vegetarian option when I preordered. there was a chicken dish on the flight so I was able to switch.
7926,Entree was overly spicy.
7927,Much much much better than the food on the way to Rome!!.
7928,No.
7929,The food was bland.
7930,"Some kind of menu would be nice, even if it was in digital form, because I only had a quick few seconds to decide when the flight attendant came around to order."
7931,Preferred option was not available. Lunch is a better choice than breakfast when serving food at lunch time.
7932,"Offer more food up front, easier to purchase."
7933,We preordered the tapas box. the crew did not receive any with catering. They kindly offered us another option. It was good.
7934,None.
7935,the take off box was better than the one I was offered on another flight. The other box had soo much processed sugar I could not eat most of the food in the box.
7936,More different stores around gate would be nice.
7937,No.
7938,Choice in snacks.
7939,If you do NOT have the type of beverage I have requested DO NOT replace it [beverage] without 1st asking. Thanks!.
7940,needed more purchase options. Only snacks were available for purchase. No fresh food.
7941,Flight from Denver to SNA I upgraded to fist and had a meal and it was not edible. I had the chicken/orzo. The worst meal I have had in a first class cabin. I fly american a lot and their meals are of much better quality.
7942,No.
7943,The flight was short so they did not serve anything.
7944,No.
7945,"The beverage service and variety was very satisfying. However the pasta was cold, small portion and just disgusting."
7946,A more modern approach.. so less cookies and sweets.
7947,No.
7948,more variety in the drinks. ginger ale preferred. heavier snack.
7949,No they were a nice surprise.
7950,No.
7951,The dessert was excellent. The center was chocolate. On my way to Sacramento on the 7 th dessert was a Kind bar. That was hardly a dessert.
7952,"I thought there would be a light snack provided with the beverage, but there was not."
7953,I was in first and my husband ate my breakfast option as there was nothing for a vegan option <:(>.
7954,I like more options for snack.
7955,"The morning breakfast selections have gotten a bit off;. 5 choices, only 1 would order/eat based on the description. Having said that, the scrambled egg plate is EXCELLENT (well cooked, good ingredients, etc). Have had a number of times & almost always perfect. Conversely, while not a comment on this particular flight - the two lunch/Dinner selections now being served (fake meatballs, spicy chicken) are both terrible;. both taste (meatballs taste like cardboard, and the dried out chicken bits with tabasco squirted on top is worse). I have had both several times now and from now on will get a snack box from the rear of the plane."
7956,No snacks provided.
7957,No snacks on a 2+ hour flight?.
7958,No.
7959,Chicken dish in first class was dry and unappealing.
7960,In first class we were offered snacks and cheese tray. The cheese tray and snack were fine. I would have liked to have a sweet alternative such as a cookie or dried fruit.
7961,The food I requested was not available.
7962,Coffee is great.
7963,The sandwich is served too hot and it [sandwich] has too many cheese instead of meat.
7964,Breakfast was soggy.
7965,I miss having more than cookies included in price of flight but understand this is cost effective.
7966,I can not get through TSA security screening with a tweezers in my carry-on but on the airplane the flight attendant gives me a 5” pointed stick to stir my coffee. You have got to be kidding me.
7967,Some more variety would be great.
7968,Maybe flight too short but not even peanuts were offered.
7969,Not a lot to offer.
7970,Better desert option.
7971,"We did get beverages offered twice, no snacks."
7972,Wine selection was dismal.
7973,Would not call it first class.
7974,Hope you will have snacks for diabetes.
7975,Pre pandemic the meals were quite delicious and excellent choices and with menu. It seems United is using the pandemic and related issues as an excuse to deliver a subpar product for its Polaris customers. The new catering contractors have yet to impress me.
7976,Food has been the same for the last six months.
7977,"No sundae, small tub ice cream offered. Limited spirits."
7978,Thank you for remembering my birthday on Sep 22nd. Flight attendant had a card put on my seat. Very thoughtful.
7979,no.
7980,The food in first class was excellent!. Very tasty and hot. I was glad to see a real napkin and metal utensils too.
7981,"I liked the overal experience. However I must point out that I ordered the burger. The meat itself tasted okay, however the bun was too hard to even bit through the top, and the bottom was soggy on one side. I would also have appreciated knowing if the burger was 100% beef or not, because this was not stated on the meal choice."
7982,The sparkling wine was ok but could (should) have been much better if it had been a Cava or a Cremant rather than Prosecco.
7983,No.
7984,No. Everything was perfect.
7985,Short flight did not serve much.
7986,The snack boxes have almonds and I am allergic so it would be nice to have non nut options. And the stand alone snacks are small or too much of a junk food. It would be nice as a 1k to be able ro chjose two stand alone snacks in lieu of a snack box. Adding the beef jerky was a good call.
7987,were not offered any sort of snack.
7988,United is missing something in the First Class service when you only pass out the same snacks as in Economy. Delta and American have a Snack Basket for First Class where you can choose from several options and they come through more than once.
7989,No.
7990,Take credit cards.
7991,No gluten free options.
7992,Small snacks with beverages.
7993,No.
7994,Needs more variety.
7995,I enjoyed the Buffalo Trace option offered.
7996,"The food that is served on United flights is ALWAYS very good tasting!!!. I actually look forward to the ""meal service""."
7997,United should start giving snacks just like some other airlines do.
7998,No.
7999,"More choices and changing them up would be appreciated. Maybe a string cheese, choice of chips, cuties, mini kind bar would be a nice change."
8000,The crewmember was really nice.
8001,I believe there were no complimentary beverage and snacks.
8002,Thank you.
8003,food i wanted popcorn it was not available.
8004,My chicken entree was served with a side dish that seemed like was supposed to be fried rice but it was cold and hard. Not edible.
8005,Allergy friendly (Gluten free/paleo) options are not hard come by — Why are are they not being offered????. This is not new!!. Get with it!!. Huge ding!!!.
8006,No.
8007,Pueden mejorar la calidad. tener más variedad de snacks.
8008,It is not clear what is free and what is to be purchased. Most airlines automatically offer soft drinks and water for free with your ticket. It was not obvious if the soft drinks were a choice or not.
8009,Stale pretzels were not good first class deserves better.
8010,Too small size way too small we need fluid!.
8011,Vegetarian options are fewer. food is average.
8012,Business class food was not so great. The choice I selected was not available.
8013,get new vendor.
8014,I have noticed on my last 2 flights you ru out of the Takeoff box very quickly.
8015,no food served.
8016,Good selection of beverages on board.
8017,"Para mi gusto, todo súper bien, lo único que el Postre no fue de mi agrado!."
8018,N/A.
8019,"It would be nice to have a diet caffeine free beverage option. Also, a snack included in the service would be nice."
8020,"I loved the pasta, the salad it came with. the turkey sandwich was so good too."
8021,Wish United could offer a diet non caffeine soda. Like diet 7up.
8022,I would like higher quality food.
8023,"Yes, the ginger ale was flat."
8024,"The vegetarian option (Impossible meatballs) actually taste like meat. I have been a vegetarian for 28 years as I do not like the taste. Of course, I brought a snack for myself. However, I would think many vegetarians do not like the taste."
8025,Only received snack boxes on this flight.
8026,I believe there was a snack but when taking a snooze it is not offered.
8027,One chicken dish was excessively spicy.
8028,Strange change to meal service: Flight attendants removed wine glasses from meal trays as they were served and did not offer any beverages with dinner.
8029,The tea was tepid and had been pre-brewed. The teabags had been allowed to seep too long.
8030,No.
8031,more snacks.
8032,none offered.
8033,"flight attendants were great, thanks."
8034,please add a smaller breakfast option for those who do not want a tray of food. there used to be a cinnamon roll option. something small that is not yogurt!. why is there so much yogurt!!!.
8035,How do we know if inflight can be purchased with miles or not.
8036,"We were not offered a second drink, so we asked for it."
8037,"I absolutely loved the food on my flight!. I wanted to say that while the vegetarian option for dinner also happened to be vegan. I would greatly enjoy seeing vegan dessert options as well as cooked vegan breakfast options beyond just fruit. Also, I was thrilled when after dinner I asked if there was any additional food available, and the flight attendants kindly served me a SECOND vegan dinner!. I was still so hungry after the first meal. they truly helped me by serving me a second dinner. Also, I was so happy when during the breakfast service the flight attendant gave me extra fruit since there was no cooked vegan breakfast option. I will be pleased to recommend United to all my friends and family. Keep up the great work!."
8038,"We had two options Eggs or Waffles. I picked waffles b/c it sounded nice to have a waffle. My husband picked eggs and they had ham in them. Neither of us eats meat. As a vegetarian, I recognize it is my choice to not eat meat. I do want to know the information so I can make informed choices. No one presented information to us about what the meal included. Eggs to me sound like just eggs, I would not assume there is meat in it unless it was presented as Eggs and Meat. Just a little elevated touch."
8039,I pressed the snack survey by mistake. you did not allow me to go back to make my real choice about your meals. This is a major flaw in your survey questionnaire. Your meal service and food was excellent!.
8040,For breakfast they ran out of egg options by the time they got to my seat - so that was rather disappointing b/c the alternative was just a yogurt and hard biscotti.
8041,We asked for a coffee at one point and they made some especially for us. Felt very well taken care of.
8042,I was served breakfast because it is a morning flight. It would be more appropriate to serve lunch instead of breakfast considering the time at destination.
8043,"I had a cup of HOT tea, because I was FROZEN in that plane. The nice flight attendant asked to turn on some heat, which helped immensely ."
8044,Everything is fine . Thank you.
8045,"There should ne a fish option, for those who do not eat any meat."
8046,More healthy choices of snacks.
8047,"It would be great if pre-flight drinks in the morning for first class included the champagne option, in addition to the water and OJ. Several flights I have been on there have been a couple people that would like a cup of champagne before take-off, even if it is just 8am!."
8048,The food is still not great. Getting better but other airlines like jet blue Air France just so much better.
8049,Meals healthy and light.
8050,Go back to two cheeses in the “take off” - please.
8051,Salad was great lunch butternut squash not so great but edible.
8052,On the flight from Houston to Amsterdam. They just did not pass around water enough times. I did not sleep. I only saw them come with some water once on the 9 hour flight other then the meals.
8053,Keep on doing what is already being done.
8054,didn't get anything.
8055,"When you pay $1,600 for a first class ticket you do not like being passed by in the food selection process by upgraders."
8056,No.
8057,Maybe offer a light snack or fruit.
8058,Better snack.
8059,Would prefer to have more food.
8060,"I was asked to, and took advantage of, the opportunity to preorder my meal several days ahead for this flight. The flight attendant was totally unaware that I had preordered. what was offered onboard did not at all match what was offered when I placed the preorder."
8061,It was a pleasant surprise to have beverages offered prior to leaving the gate in first class. That has not happened in a while.
8062,The app had my card on wallet however flight attendant was not able to verify that. I was not able to purchase food or beverages.
8063,Wish they could have more diet drinks without caffeine.
8064,"Too much turbulence to have service, which is understandable on such a short flight."
8065,The portion size and variety were fine. The service was EXCELLENT!. My only thing about Food is that the quality was just fine. I had a biz class ticket and wanted Beef but was told there was not enough available and so I had to choose a back up choice chicken. The chicken was dry and not that tasty at all.
8066,Gluten free.
8067,Service was efficient and friendly.
8068,NA.
8069,Coffee was a surprising delight.
8070,"Did not receive an option on the snack. When flying first class, I was expecting more than a fancy cookie."
8071,"Healthy foods to supply, if can!."
8072,"More if it, please."
8073,no chargers on a flight with no in-seat devices that is over 5 hours was a big downside. I am usually loyal to American. I will be going back after this experience overall.
8074,Pretzels stale.
8075,Had no decaf coffee available.
8076,Wine was good. Would like a few more to choose from.
8077,For the cost of the ticket consider providing a snack and/or drink options like almond milk.
8078,I would love it if United started offering Dr. Pepper (or similar).
8079,"The flight attendant did not give me the soda. gave me only a cup!. When I request the can, she said there is no enough for the flight!. However the flight is only half full!. When I ask a second flight attendant, he provide me a can!."
8080,"Cheese Tray was the only option, but it was perfect for me for this flight."
8081,We were not offered our free snack.
8082,There were no Complementary snacks offered.
8083,Mo.
8084,Nice to have real milk- cream would have been better.
8085,"If you were not at your seat, no snack will be given."
8086,"For a long flight like this 9 hours), some small snacks would be nice. These could be some nuts, shortbread packets (like BA does), available for request or just in the galley. The pretzel nuggets (only snack available) were a bit unappetizing."
8087,We are premier members and always enjoy our time in the club waiting for our flight to load.
8088,"It took 90 minutes after wheels up to be served dinner. This is a bit long, considering it is a red eye and passengers would like to sleep as soon as able."
8089,"Thanks for the food, right on time."
8090,The food was delicious!.
8091,We were not given a choice on snacks. It was just pretzels. Would be nice to have a sweet and a salty choice.
8092,The snacks should be free.
8093,Coffee and tea in flight seems to be consistently below average in taste and temperature. Healthy snack options and food for purchase option Are not good.
8094,All was cold.
8095,I believe the overall quality of the food could be much better especially in the premium plus cabin. I was more than a little disappointment with the food.
8096,Need to find better snacks.
8097,I requested a gluten-free meal and it was absolutely delicious. I was very happy.
8098,"Nice and smooth… disappointed that there was no TVs, but arrived early. So it was a very nice flight."
8099,Nothing.
8100,No.
8101,"What happened to the snacks- pretzels, cookie??. You should at least provide something for us."
8102,The question on “complimentary” does not make sense to me. My understanding is that the food/beverage is priced in the ticket.
8103,I wish that the food were warm or little hot.
8104,Coffee was great would like some protein for a snack.
8105,No.
8106,Would have liked 2 cookie packs.
8107,More options and free meals.
8108,For the size offer 2 (maybe) or get a bigger size.
8109,No.
8110,Do not like you choice of snacks. Pretzels were NOT offered.
8111,No.
8112,The food options have been the same for a number of months now. Time to change them up.
8113,Mango is not a common ice cream flavor. A choice would have been good.
8114,I requested.
8115,"For all flights, especially Polaris class, Cutty Sark Scotch is CRAP!!. Get a Glenmorangie 12 or Macallan 12. The type of people paying $3k for a seat do not drink this garbage and United has a huge blindspot. Cutty Sark should not be served in 1st class or Polaris…."
8116,More options some things stay on the Meuse to long.
8117,No.
8118,I liked the other chocolate that used to be in Tapas box better.
8119,"Burger was rare. I just nibbled the edges, can not have rare flesh. Ingredient lists would help me select foods so I can avoid mushroom allergy."
8120,"The breakfast main dish was acceptable;. the side dish I could not identify. I recently flew with partner airline Singapore Airlines and the differences in menu options is stark. I have been flying Polaris business for 5 years now, and it is time for some global influences on your menu."
8121,I loved united.
8122,"Unlike other airlines, the flight attendant did not go around to offer more drinks throughout the night. They only come during meal time."
8123,Very bad quality of food.
8124,Excellent.
8125,one more option for food like a granola bar or nuts.
8126,"Did not get my chosen meal because another passenger asked to switch seats. By the time the flight attendant asked me, she said she would have to take the meal from someone else if I wanted it. Understandable since I volunteered to switch seats."
8127,I think only two types of larger were available. there was no IPA. It had ran out.
8128,Vegetarian option was terrible.
8129,the meal.
8130,It is fine.
8131,chicken tika was tasteless though I was warned it would be spicy. The salad dressing was also tasteless. Salt and pepper shaken were useless. Could not get anything out of the small holes. .
8132,No snack was offered.
8133,Need better selection of snacks.
8134,My flight was good. There was no special meal from SFO to NRT. Customer Service has to special order the meal from Tokyo to Saipan. Saipan is unable to assist with Special Meals. They may need more training. On-line ordering does not seem to work either.
8135,Liked that you had Dr Pepper (edge over SWA). Wish you had decaf tea on late flights.
8136,Need to serve more water for such a long flight.
8137,not much... it reminded me the quality of food one received in Coach not so long ago. Not appealing.
8138,"I so appreciate you guys for carrying Coke Zero (it is much better than Diet Coke), and I also love that you carry ginger-ale for my husband."
8139,Need to offer snacks too!.
8140,no.
8141,"What is become of the Stroopwaffle?. Is it only offered on morning flights?. If so, I wish it [Stroopwaffle] were offered all day. It is my favorite snack, morning, afternoon, or night. The red wine I had was a blend, and it was a good one. I am sometimes offered a choice of red wines, but was not on this flight."
8142,I was happy to get the full can of soda and not just a small cup.
8143,I would have liked more food options for purchase on the flight.
8144,no.
8145,Great selections and the food was very tasty!.
8146,Prefer Budlights on Board.
8147,"No. Good service, thanks!."
8148,"Need better tasting food, more choices."
8149,Beef dinner excellent!. Egg brealfast not so good. Eggs were hard.
8150,No.
8151,Excellent service and excellent food !.
8152,Not at all.
8153,Yes the issue with pre-ordering food is that the attendants do not automatically offer it. We pre-ordered food for our son on another flight and it was never provided. He apparently would have had to ask for it. We pre-ordered on this flight and were not offered our pre-order until we asked about it. I believe the flight attendants can see pre-orders so may we suggest that they proactively act on those.
8154,"Would appreciate if you return to the former food schedule, especially on a long flight, with little opportunity to purchase during short connecting time for next flight."
8155,"No food was served, only beverage."
8156,Would love to always have pretzels as an option as opposed to two sweet options. <😬>.
8157,More vegan options.
8158,"Basic, the bare minimum."
8159,Coffee was not available as there was problem with water.
8160,would like to see iced tea (unsweetened) offered.
8161,The cold meal was unappetizing.
8162,Gold chicken is not a dinner item. Hot dinner is supposed to be offered.
8163,Only served pretzel or stroopwafel -- in business class.... and everything was closed at the airport except the news stands and it was a 6:30pm flight landing at 8:22....
8164,The person across from me was continually brought other items like a cheese plate and snacks that did not seem to be offered to anyone else.
8165,More variety and more quantity.
8166,"Dinner roll & dessert cookie in plastic wrappers. Same meal on next flight were unwrapped - more appealing presentation. Real dishes, utensils & cloth napkins nice."
8167,Iced tea.
8168,It is so nice to have complementary snack options. I hate pretzels so was delighted to able to choose cookies.
8169,Out of Gingerale.
8170,Need better selection and quantity.
8171,Bring back the Dasani lime sparkling water. Would like to see a non alcoholic beer option.
8172,No.
8173,Wish you had healthier options including bananas for vegan clients as you did in the past. More variety of nuts as well.
8174,I was surprised that we were not offered the can of juice or soda. the flight was far from full. I was in economy plus.
8175,"Please provide a free snack (peanuts / pretzels, etc.). When a flight leaves at 6:00am, we had to getup at 4:00am or earlier and did not have time for breakfast. For the price of a several-hundred-dollar ticket, you ought to be able to afford $1 worth of free snacks."
8176,I was disappointed that there were not any free snacks available on this flight.
8177,It was a limited selection compared to other flights. Prefer kosher as I know there will not be dairy.
8178,Better food quality.
8179,Nothing.
8180,Food was quite bland. I had the fish that was being served on that flight.
8181,"There was a final sandwich served (late, due to turbulence) but my wife and I did not receive. I assumed the flight attendants were in a hurry and skipped our seats by accident."
8182,"$9 for a very mediocre bottle of white wine is too much. Alaska does a really cool thing - they work with local (Pacific NW/California, etc) wineries and showcase really interesting, tasty wines. The only choice I had for white wine was chardonnay. I have 'status' on AS - none on UAL - so maybe that is part of it."
8183,It would be great to cookies and crackers or pretzels. Cookies and cookies is not a choice.
8184,"There were 2 gluten free meals. my ratings in the survey are mixed from both meals. It would be better if the survey allowed feedback on dinner and breakfast separately. The dinner was good - it was a beef dish with rice and vegetables. I would rate as an 8/10. I enjoyed the meal, however the delicious salad only came with an olive oil packet, rather than an actual dressing - vinaigrette, etc. I had to ask the flight attendant for the option that came with the regular meals (there is no flour/gluten in oil or vinegar) as the regular dressing was fine to consume. The fruit was also tasty and I enjoyed it. However the breakfast was very salty and was not appealing. It was scrambled eggs, spinach, and a half tomato. I ate one bite of the eggs, and was surprised at how salty it was. I tried the spinach, and it too was salty. I ate the tomato and the fruit. Strangely, it also came with a juice box. although there is no gluten (flour) in regular orange juice, which the flight attendant offered me with my meal. Overall I rate this meal a 2/10. One last note - both meals on the flight from Houston to Rio were delicious and I would eat again (dinner was a curry and breakfast was a apple oatmeal with fruit)."
8185,Needs better food options.
8186,Including food.
8187,need real snacks.
8188,offer more food and better food. improvement is necessary.
8189,More filling options would have been nice.
8190,No.
8191,It was hot.
8192,It was ok.
8193,Restricting first order alcohol sales to one is childish and clogs the aisles.
8194,Did not have the beers stated on the menu.
8195,Would be good to give peanuts or pretzels in short distance flights. Or some companies have a menu where you can buy sandwiches or nachos. In my case connection was with 40 minutes only so was hard to get lunch in the airport.
8196,Waffle was soggy. No snacks offered during the over 5 hour trip.
8197,I received a whole can of coca cola.
8198,Perhaps a water-only service on this short flight could have been done.
8199,"no, did not get anything. Mistakenly did not do the PHX-MSY flight to share with you. there is nothing to share on the MSY flight."
8200,The chicken dinner actually tasted much better than I expected. What a pleasant surprise!.
8201,There was no snack.
8202,"no, just very limited."
8203,"used to hand out a cookie or biscuit, would have been a nice touch."
8204,"On flights that are 3 or more hours, I think a small sandwich would be nice to have. After flying most of the day, snacks are not enough."
8205,Please offer more gluten free options.
8206,"On UA871 they offer a non vegetarian food . It looks like as soft rice.It is not common food to Taiwan people. I take it the first time in my life. If we can have common food, it feels like welcome home."
8207,no chardonnay some horrible pinot grigio. cabernet was so so.
8208,Not really a long enough flight to really need much.
8209,Fish entree was great. The Cheeseburger snack was not good.
8210,It would be nice if the complimentary snack size is doubled.
8211,It would be nice if snacks were provided but the drinks were good. the food purchase items are a good selection as well. All attendants were very friendly.
8212,Would have liked more variety in food to purchase.
8213,Meal were finished and got spinazie thing.
8214,Perfect sized snack for the flight.
8215,No.
8216,The food and beverage should be offered at the same time.
8217,"We purchased first class tickets, but were not notified in any way of the privileges of flying 1st class. Apparently there were few if any privileges other than seats in front of plane & boarding first!!!."
8218,No.
8219,The fish dish I had was delicious and also the ice cream.
8220,Did not are for the entree selection. A sandwich option or burger would be better.
8221,No.
8222,I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and flavor of my chicken entree. It was hot and tasty. So nice than your traditional hard as a rock sandwich. And the coffee flavored gelato dessert was delicious!. Very satisfied!.
8223,This survey asked if I received a complimentary meal on board which was confusing. I paid for first class/Polaris seating. received meal service as part of the fare structure. I would not refer to this as a “complimentary meal”.
8224,N/A.
8225,There should still be snacks offered for free instead of having to purchase them.
8226,"Sorry to say this because I loved our attendant but on our prior flight, Delta, they were much more attentive and food was excellent."
8227,I miss the warm nuts in first class.
8228,Love the Illy coffee!.
8229,"The snacks were not appropriate for the ""time of day"". The snacks need to be more VARIED. Pretzels and Sweets tart were NOT enough choice, especially in 1st Class cabin."
8230,Selection between pretzel or biscoff not good for people that can not eat gluten. What happened to waffle cookies?. If I have to eat gluten at least that was pleasant.
8231,Upon being delayed and sitting on hot aircraft we should have been Offered water.
8232,"Disappointed not to get complimentary pretzels, chips, or snack."
8233,"the quality of the entree was VERY bad. it was salmon (I think!). , but it was so dried out and overcooked that it was a hard white lump that more resembled chicken. the vegetables were wilted. the rice was dry. the seasoning was bland. the side options and the OTHER food was just fine. the entree was quite shockingly BAD!. (& I believe it was the normal fish entree, not something special because I requested gluten free)."
8234,On 3 out of the 4 flights in the trip the plane was out of soda water Not sure if it makes sense to serve an unheated croissant for breakfast when it is designed for heating (oven safe bag) - I saw the 7 people with in my vision all discard them.
8235,I enjoyed the meal.
8236,meal choices were nothing more than glorified snacks with lots of the same kind of foods.
8237,thanks.
8238,"Time for more variation of selections. Same old thing every flight. Dessert is circa 1975;. terrible. As a matter of fact the meal was just better than Coach, 1975. How much could the Sundae cart have cost?. What a nice touch that was. On an 8 hour flight, there is no reason why First Class meals aren;. t served in courses."
8239,No.
8240,It was a long flight hoping for another round of drinks.
8241,"For this extreme delay all on United, drinks and wifi should have been free."
8242,No.
8243,Food was cold.
8244,Na.
8245,the egg sandwich was not at all tasty. Bread was plastic and cheese processed.
8246,Please have a lease what you have in your menu. I asked for an apple juice and they did not have it.
8247,The price was right!!!.
8248,adequate but not a lot of choice.
8249,I appreciated a full 12 oz. beverage given the length of the flight.
8250,No beverage Svc due to short flight and bumpy ride. Diet Coke is the only sugar-free offering other than water. Need sprite or other.
8251,Yes I think United should give aleast a little more like variety in cookies.
8252,Only offered a drink with “lunch”. used to before flight took off. Then again as we got In the air and continuously through flight. Noticed this past few times we have flown after the pandemic. Just cheapens the experience when you are paying triple what everyone else is.
8253,What happened to snacks?.
8254,0.
8255,There have to be better options for gluten free in first class and economy.
8256,I liked that the desert was something local from Iceland!!.
8257,"That all, thank you."
8258,Food outlets at sfo we are closed due to strike. There was a table of free snacks offered by United. That was welcoming!.
8259,No.
8260,N/a.
8261,Not offered food.
8262,None.
8263,More meal choices.
8264,Would have liked to not have to choose between biscoff and pretzels.
8265,"puerto rico ron ""DQ""."
8266,There should be a larger selection of items beside the snacks.
8267,White wine was not drinkable. No choice.
8268,Polaris menu was very disappointing for an 11 hour flight. 2 choices of which neither was very good or special. The salad was very delicious.
8269,A cold or hot sandwich or salad and bread would have been more appealing.
8270,"The chicken was kind of spicy. which did not make sense when you are stuck on a 10.5 hour flight. Some flavor on the chicken is good, but not spicy."
8271,We did not realize we could not make other drink purchases without having our credit card downloaded ahead of time. I was not able to input one because I was already on the plane when I found out. The emails had said input one to ease purchases but did not say this will be the only way to purchase anything. I would recommend being more explicit.
8272,No.
8273,Pretty plane in the presentation and food option was ok. Definitely area for improvement.
8274,No snack was offered on either of my flights. I was kind of disappointed.
8275,"I know vegan is tare, but it is fairly easy to accommodate, and I value it greatly."
8276,By the time the paid snack cart came by. The selection I was waiting for was sold out. It seems like more people are selecting the healthier choices when flying.
8277,No.
8278,No.
8279,This served cold chicken dish was awesome in all aspects. The overall mean complexity was great. Honestly one of the best FC meals I have had.
8280,Choices were the same as my inbound flights. Was hoping for something different.
8281,The snack portions were extremely small.
8282,"Well, it was unclear before flying if I would even get served. In the past food and beverages were just expected, but before my recent flight it was not clear how my credit card, or even if my credit card would be used to pay for food and beverages."
8283,The food was ok. But it has been the same me options at every airport I have been to lately. There needs to be a little different of a regional variety.
8284,No other snack was offered complimentary.
8285,Just great.
8286,The salad was dry and not fresh in look and taste. The burger bun was reheated and hard but also greasy from the pate inside. Very unappealing.
8287,The service started 2 hours into the flight. I would have preferred it sooner.
8288,No.
8289,No it was all good.
8290,"Need to offer more than 2 snack options, need to offer fruit or yogurt or something other than a carb. As to beverages, good selection."
8291,Increase leg space. No extra seat charges!!!.
8292,"Chicken entree was delicious and healthy. Appreciated the quinoa and salad, fruit, cookie and bread roll. Wonderful surprise to receive a delicious and healthy meal for free!!."
8293,I would definitely fly united again.
8294,Better food option would be great.
8295,the food in first class should more than pretzels a waffle cookie.
8296,None was offered.
8297,Surprise treat to receive complimentary beverage!.
8298,The food was soggy and mushy. Not appealing.
8299,No.
8300,"The simpler offerings were the best, like the fruit and halfway decent roll for breakfast."
8301,The chicken entree was unappetizing and had very little actual chicken in it. A starchy main dish was accompanied by a quinoa salad (both flights) and the two did not complement each other.
8302,"The champagne offer at the beginning of the flight is very classy. Love the warm nuts snack, also."
8303,No snack.
8304,No.
8305,Need more snacks than a tiny bag of pretzels.
8306,Please have decaf coffee that is not instant<👍>.
8307,"Would have liked a snack, like crackers or cookie."
8308,I guess the bad white wine was from Amsterdam to Houston.
8309,Already commented in initial comments.
8310,It really was not a breakfast meal and I thought it could have been better.
8311,"Seemed like attendants were willing to serve alcoholic beverages, but not enthused about it."
8312,"The pretzels tasted stale. Can you please offer something healthy with some nutrition in it besides pretzels or the biscotti cookie?. For example, almonds?."
8313,Only that with short flight we had none.
8314,I am not sure First Class food service has ever recovered post-COVID and I also not sure that the airline is motivated to return to pre-COVID standards for budgetary reasons.
8315,None.
8316,"The croissant was dry, maybe stale."
8317,No.
8318,Bring back full pre departure beverages.
8319,"Why do you not even offer a small snack (pretzels, granola, nuts, cookies for instance)?. No snack was provided."
8320,I miss the pretzels/snacks.
8321,If they can offer coffe or other during the flight.
8322,Good experience all round.
8323,I wish they could serve even half of shandwiches .
8324,more variety and less asking if i want an alcoholic drink.
8325,Flight was fine. On prior flight (737) my feet kept going to sleep because there was NO Room to move.
8326,Not sure why United offers snacks for sale when other airlines give it [sale] out as a complimentary offering.
8327,The bread was hard like a rock and not edible. The entree needs more work. Not very tasty.
8328,Reduce packaging - so much disposable plastic. Even the salt and pepper pots were single use plastic balls - they all add up and could be replaced by paper sachets. The sandwiches were not great - all stale and very little filling. Not what you would expect in business. Very thing else was great.
8329,good.
8330,A snack would have been nice.
8331,I asked the flight attendant if the chicken was spicy. she said she did not know. I still took it and regretted my choice. It was too spicy.
8332,Be nice to have more than one choice.
8333,Food was not available for preorder on the outbound flight EWR-PBI. It was available to preorder on the return flight.
8334,"Lunch was delicious, well prepared, and well presented. Thanks!."
8335,no.
8336,Expected a small snack as well.
8337,More gf dinner options would be great.
8338,The chicken and quinoa with salad was great and had good flavor but it was really really dry. Just a package of Italian or some sort of dressing would have made the meal fantastic!.
8339,Different varieties.
8340,I liked how frequent the staff brought around beverages instead of just one.
8341,More choices and food was good and hot.
8342,"I think it is a no go to ask customer to download an app, add lots of personal information plus credit card information to allow any kind of inflight purchase. This needs to be changed. It may be applicable and comfortable for some customers but it is a no go for people which fly rarely with united. Just imagine every airline forces you to do so ?. How many apps would you need if you are a frequent traveller ?."
8343,Only drinks and no snacks cookies or nuts.
8344,My previous comments about food were on the international section of my flight with United from San Francisco to London and did not relate to the sector Vancouver to San Francisco.. I thought the food offered was deplorable.
8345,Time to step up the game n provide higher quality meals.
8346,"N/A I just wanted to sleep. I had water with me so I did not need any from you. I always have water with me so, no offense."
8347,No service because of short time but Jacob was nice enough to get me a bottle of water.
8348,"having a beef, fish, chicken, veg & salad option."
8349,The food could be better. Salmon is tough to prepare for this type of journey but it could still be better. I only ate half the salmon but ate all the other veggies and stuff on the plate.
8350,Good food and nice flight.
8351,Snacks on even short flights would be nice. Just some pretzels or something.
8352,"Two snacks at least, guys. Please."
8353,great to have food back !.
8354,As for the dessert it was a cookie on both flights.
8355,Better snacks.
8356,I am a seasoned traveler. Not overweight. Eat normal sizes for a non American but I the portions where REALLY small.
8357,Ran out of drinking water on the flight. A bit disappointed.
8358,The dish was great except that the chicken was worst-case bone dry. Not a fatal complaint but it is an opportunity for improvement.
8359,Would like snack offered.
8360,Good service and snack options!.
8361,"Only water and OJ was served pre departure, no sparkling wine."
8362,From Honolulu to sf you need to have Mai tais on menu.
8363,The new in flight snacks (waffle and biscotti) are a welcome upgrade from trail mix.
8364,Higher quality wine would be nice.
8365,"Customer should be able to have a bottle of water if they like. not just a cocktail size cup, especially in premium/plus seats as we pay more money."
8366,"A more inspiring vegetarian option would be good. Cous cous and veg was a bit bland, and no protein. A choice would have been good."
8367,No complimentary box or alcohol offered to 1K member.
8368,First class was great but need some more snack options.. I do love the Stoopwaffle but maybe some other snacks to choose from like AA First Class does.
8369,we were not offered anything for a snack on our flight.
8370,No. It was fine.
8371,No.
8372,Sneak print to landing in Germany was very light.
8373,Best in flight meal I have had since Covid. I hope this is the start of a return to decent in flight meals in premium cabins this was even better than Polaris a few weeks ago.
8374,Servers seemed bored or tired or both.
8375,All was very good.
8376,None.
8377,Bring back ice cream sundaes with all the toppings. Separate the courses again.
8378,The egg breakfast was not very good.
8379,Need to upgrade the food provided in business/first class.
8380,"because the drink was small, it [drink] had a lot of ice, and I needed the whole can, but I did not have it."
8381,Very confusing about how to purchase drinks or food.
8382,i had hoped First class woukd be offered a beverage upon boarding. nothing offered and we were 30 mins delayed.
8383,The Tofu entree was delicious. I am happy they offer a vegetarian choice.
8384,"Phx to Denver while can. Denver to Des Moines, do you want the whole can!. Why yes I do, the cup in full of ice!."
8385,No thank you.
8386,Wine list is open for improvement.
8387,Good Sauvignon Blanc!.
8388,None of my flights had apple juice.
8389,No.
8390,None.
8391,No.
8392,Maybe provide a little bigger bag of snack.
8393,No complimentary snack pretzels or nuts.
8394,Good.
8395,It would be great if there were a gluten free option for snacks.
8396,"Was only offered a cup of ice water, thought soda should have been offerd."
8397,More variety will be exciting to see and to have.
8398,On time.
8399,No.
8400,None at this time.
8401,No.
8402,Creative food selection.
8403,It was just ok.
8404,Always think it could be cheaper.
8405,No.
8406,"Your good improved very much, we like it."
8407,"At first I thought it was odd that you did not accept credit cards on board. I had my card added to my account, and I did not have to get it out to make a purchase, which was actually nice!."
8408,apparently biscotti is not offered on flights less than 800 miles.
8409,It would be nice to have more variety on snacks with a long flight and food.
8410,You need an option of N/A since they were not available to passengers.
8411,Three flights provided a full can of soda !. One flight only offered a small cup.
8412,"On our flight form IND to DEN we received an email prior to flight to choose our meal. Great idea and it worked well. Returning form DEN to IND we did not get the same option. Meals ran out prior to reaching our row in first class, row 5. Snack boxes were ok, but really?."
8413,"No, but need to have some place to eat inside."
8414,No.
8415,Attendants were great. Flight was comfortable. Pilot speakers were hard to hear him talk. As i mentioned Polaris business class is dated and needs a refresh compared to competitors.
8416,"When the dinner was served there was a nice glass. however we (basically everybody) never got anything to put in. Bu the time the wine was served, the dinner was eaten already (otherwise it would have gotten cold). I did expect better for Premium Economy."
8417,No.
8418,short flight so understand beverage only service.
8419,They served nothing. Flight was short.
8420,All good.
8421,I was satisfied.
8422,I wish there were more options. the preboarding request was easier.
8423,Great job <👏>.
8424,No food or beverages during that flight.
8425,No.
8426,Needs improvement.
8427,"I would suggest better free snack n beverages, organic juice, snacks that are not all sugar.. healthy alternatives."
8428,In first class you still get nothing….
8429,Snacks should still be given on every flight.
8430,"Flight from San Francisco to Eugene was fine. Good beverage selection. However, there was zero beverage served on the return flight. Very inconsistent service quality despite being the same flight length on the same route."
8431,"There should be a menu with what items are available, in each seat net. I tried to look online during flight but could not find anything and I sat at the window seat so I did not want to to be loud about what was available."
8432,Pretzels were stale.
8433,Excellent breakfast.
8434,"better food choice, more diet soda choice."
8435,Fair !. Should have better choice of breakfast and lunch .
8436,Chicken was very dry and tough!!.
8437,Chicken entree was very dry and tough. Unable to eat it [entree]. Do not serve chicken unless you know how to prepare it.
8438,Food selection is so limited . Each flight should serve different sandwiches as an option instead of just snack boxes.
8439,More food options would be ideal.
8440,"This is a 1 hour flight. I have taken many 1 hour flights between Southern California and the Bay Area with other airlines. All other airlines make a single pass through the plane for one round of drinks and/or snacks. On this United flight, they announced that it was too short of a flight so they would not offer refreshments."
8441,"While the meals were, overall, very good, the breakfast meal coming into the UK was different. On offer was either pancakes or chicken slaschick(?). The chicken was somewhat odd for a breakfast offering. I chose it. the chicken dish, as I said would have been better as a lunch/dinner option, did not sit well as a breakfast offering. The pancakes looked very appealing."
8442,Bring back the stroopwafel. So much better than pretzels or the dry cookie.
8443,"The variety is poor in business class. I had two flights on the same day and was only given the same two options. For the impossible meatballs meal, the broccoli was completely overdone and inedible. The chicken dish was spicier than necessary. Only one dessert option was given which was fine."
8444,"Would have liked a large size snack and possibly more than 2 fir the length of flight. The person seated next to me got a large snack box, do not tease others - give the box to every passenger on your flight - thanks."
8445,the coffee was good!.
8446,More Gluten free options.
8447,no service due to turbulence.
8448,Do not make us use the vans to move to the airport.
8449,Maybe just supply pretzels or cookies--.
8450,Excellent passenger care. The flight attendants were very impressive!!!.
8451,would like to be offered decaf coffee.
8452,No coffee only decaf.
8453,"It would be wonderful if there were some healthier, less sugary options."
8454,Bread and dessert was cold.
8455,Ran out of wine. Kids food option would be appreciated.
8456,Requested Bag of Jerky - out of stock.
8457,Very happy with the direction of travel for meal services. I fly A LOT. so variety and preordering is VERY appreciated!.
8458,"I am sorry. you all need a huge revamp on food. There are minimal selections (for a cross-country flight). Even when food is offered, it is subpar."
8459,The menu showed you serve a single malt scotch. there was only one small airline bottle for the whole plane.
8460,"very good quality of food and portion, in comparing to other airlines United was better."
8461,"My wife had the ""not meat"" meatballs, and said they were horrible. She does not eat chicken, so this was the only other choice. We should have asked for a snack pack."
8462,The food options were minimal.
8463,"I had a special meal request. this was handled seamlessly. Plus, the food was actually pretty good!. Given how difficult it is for me to eat 'safely' while traveling, I was extremely pleased with the quality and ease of assessing what I was eating. The inclusion of ingredient lists on the food I was served did a lot to help me feel comfortable with eating. United took something that is often a difficult part of my travel and made it very pleasant."
8464,no hope to fly again soon.
8465,Please improve the red wine offering in First Class. There are many wonderful wines with a screw-top option. Plumpjack has a great Cabernet <🍷>.
8466,There needs to be a gluten free option on snacks. My husband has to eat gluten free and there were no gluten free snacks that he could have so he did not get to enjoy a snack like I did.
8467,none.
8468,coffee !!.
8469,"limited selection, but understandable with large passenger involved and trying to keep costs down."
8470,I would have expected an offering of a complimentary alcoholic beverage on the flight to compensate for the 4 hour delay and having to deplane and then get on another aircraft as a goodwill gesture. That was not offered.
8471,I am happy I was able to pre order and that there were a few choices. For the most part the meal was what I hoped for.
8472,Nice to pay in app.
8473,Nothing.
8474,I would love it if you starting offering Dr. Pepper (or similar)!.
8475,maybe offer stevia as a sweetener option.. but I bring my own so not a huge issue.
8476,The variety on all flights has been poor this season. It has been the same two choices in first for every flight I have taken. A change of options is highly recommended for all meal times.
8477,The cost for paid snacks is way too much along with if you want to purchase an alcoholic beverage.
8478,No.
8479,It would be good if they pass more often to pick up the trash.
8480,it would be good if I could get an idea of what wines were offered rather than just choosing red or white. Eg I might chose a white if it were Sauv Blanc and the only red was a Zinfandel... I realize this is just a personal choice. I am sure others have their preferences as well.
8481,Please Increase the quality of the food and adopt more environmental friendly packages.
8482,Typical airline food.
8483,"Not enough variety in choice. Waffle was too mushy -- overcooked, I think!!."
8484,We did not even get a little bag of pretzels.
8485,coffee was horrible.
8486,"I realize food is very hard to do at 30,000 ft. I think any time you are having to reheat meat, it is going to dry out. It is just very hard to avoid. Ultimately if you were able to offer more healthy options, I would be thrilled. I always bring my own food <:)>."
8487,Offering a free alcoholic beverage to those traveling for a special event such as the IAFF is a great way to win customers when making future travel plans.
8488,Would like a bigger portion.
8489,Everything was fine.
8490,"I like the tray. Everything is on it, you do not get handed bits and pieces (like Qantas) Side salad, main meal ice cream, great."
8491,"Food was great but too much, may want to consider smaller bar food options-- cheese and crackers, wings and chips, salsa and chips."
8492,It was a very quick flight. Snacks and water was offered. Which is totally fine for such a short flight.
8493,Food was good. Just flight from Denver to Maui unsatisfactory.
8494,"Iced tea would be a nice addition to your limited offerings, as would lemon in addition to, or in place of limes."
8495,Canadian whiskey.
8496,We requested Chardonnay They only had Pinot Grigio <🤮> We drank it because there was other options!.
8497,"In general, the food in flights and in the lounge lack variety."
8498,No.
8499,Nothing.
8500,United's inability to address my gluten-free diet requirements is unacceptable (it is why I generally prefer Delta over UA).
8501,Should offer a wider variety.
8502,"I had to wait a long time to be offered water. Before flights to Israel you usually are not permitted to carry liquids on to the plane. The first offer of water was with the meal service, over an hour into the flight. Offering water on boarding would be very helpful and healthy."
8503,It was an 18 minute flight. We actually had to wait on the plane in Monterey for almost 30 minutes before taking off. Would have been nice to have some water offered.
8504,No.
8505,Ran out of beer.
8506,Coffee maker was not working.
8507,"Just because white claws are gf does not mean I want them or can have them. Please get Tito's vodka, it is gf and made in USA. Also, stock the ginger ale. Sprite is NOT the same. I can not have lemons and they are in sprite."
8508,I would like decaf black tea as an option. There should be more variety of food choices between flights.
8509,It was a great flight.
8510,Need more non Indian meal options for dinner and breakfast.
8511,"Although not environmentally correct, maybe offer water bottles?."
8512,The Kosher food could have been more tasty.
8513,The price for what you receive is not even worth purchasing.
8514,just very nice service.
8515,I did not feel the entree was nearly as good as you thought it was in presenting it. Only alternative was unspecified stir fried veggies. The chicken dish was more rice than anything.
8516,You should always include a gluten free option with your snacks.
8517,"There was nothing on this leg of the journey, but the International leg if flight food was good."
8518,Id love to see you include peanuts!!!.
8519,Loved that they had cranberry juice onboard.
8520,"Would love more options for a slightly cheaper price, but satisfied overall."
8521,Food can be improved especially with the cost of ticket.
8522,Ran out of choices so we got what was left.
8523,No Prosecco.
8524,Airplane food in general can be improved.
8525,The ice cream was frozen solid. the chocolate was dried.
8526,Vegetarian meal option was tasty.
8527,Wish the Stroffel was an option.
8528,Getting better!.
8529,no.
8530,Could use bigger cups.
8531,Had no service. None. Nada. Zip.
8532,I just could not find how to use the app to buy something.
8533,"Although I preordered, apparently there was no record of that. How about offering something light, healthy & flavorful?."
8534,In general I thing the portions should be bigger.
8535,No.
8536,I think that for your card members. you should give X number of tickets for free beverages/food each flight or throughout the year. 5 tickets a year would go a long way for customer satisfaction.
8537,Wish there were more options in first class and a second service for such long flight.
8538,Free snacks please (like AA).
8539,The menu of the beverages and snakes were not on the seats so I did not ask about them would have been nice to know.
8540,Nothing was offered.
8541,Even on the short flights I would like to get something to drink.
8542,I suggest healthier choice of snacks.
8543,chicken option was quite spicy (the red sauce especially) Rest of meal was fine.
8544,Much better food than the Newark to Geneva flight taken three weeks before.
8545,Yes. 6 ounces of water is not sufficient for length of flight b.
8546,Would of been nice to have pretzels and a cookie.
8547,The breakfast was very poor… just yogurt and coffe!.
8548,Wishing for the old fashioned's.
8549,wish you can preorder with less than 24 hours notice.
8550,No food was offered.
8551,This was a first class ticket. 2.5 hours at lunchtime. Only a cookie and a drink. Not acceptable.
8552,I was not offered any…even though the flight was delayed for over and hour.
8553,None.
8554,A complimentary snack was not offered.
8555,"More options with less or no sugar. More choices that are not high-carb. More nuts, fruits, vegetables."
8556,1/3 of a can?.
8557,Food was a cold meal. Would prefer hot option. Taste was ok.
8558,Nothing.
8559,No.
8560,They should have offered snacks and drinks twice one time at the beginning and again 30 minutes or so before arrival. It was a long NS flight. Thanks.
8561,"In addition to a beverage, a snack would be helpful/appreciated (e.g., pretzels)."
8562,"On a flight of this length I expected to receive the whole can, but did not and was not asked if I wanted the can."
8563,I had a full meal and it was excellent.
8564,Breakfast entree was delicious.
8565,No to spicy foods. Maybe a nice full chicken salad?.
8566,No good beer.
8567,Easier way to get refills on beverages.
8568,More variety snacks Portion size is too small need larger size Need more food availability not only snacks.
8569,Breakfast items were way too sweet and I am very fussy about scrambled eggs so did not order those.
8570,"Warm food was simply gross. Burger bun was soaked with water/grease, and inedible."
8571,"On a previous flight in first class, the brioche cheeseburger was not appetizing as it melted and stuck to the plate."
8572,Would like to have had a snack.
8573,no.
8574,I like flights where whole cans are offered rather than just 1 serving in a cup.
8575,Would appreciate more variety.
8576,We asked at the gate what was being served but it would have been nice if they would have offered us a chance to buy a snack box instead of trying to find something at the kiosks in the airport.
8577,"Bread firm and not fresh/soft, half chicken club not very tasty,."
8578,I flew from hong kong to newark. the meal was excellent. better than in previous yeares.
8579,I chose the same chicken on one flight going to San Diego and on two returning to DCA. I chose it as I did not want the vegetarian meatballs. The chicken was spicier than it should have been. the rice has a slightly sour taste. I know food needs to be spicer at altitude but it was high for that.
8580,Hoping for a bag of snacks.
8581,More selections.
8582,no.
8583,NO offering of a snack with my status. I wanted to comment on my flight from Memphis to Denver and say that the flight attendent did not have any snacks given to the flight but went out of her way to find something for my wife and I and was super helpful and kind!.
8584,Salad for both meals coming and going need salad dressing. Not available with meals. We could not just eat lettuce plain.
8585,"We were happy they offered us a vegetarian meal (we eat a plant based diet) but noticed a lot of people did NOT select the tofu choice and they ran out of the chicken. Maybe next time, you should just offer a pasta dish with vegetables - it probabably would have more universal appeal."
8586,The flight attendants only offered beverage service once;. never came back through to offer water.
8587,More vegetarian options. Had only chicken or meat as Options I did not request food in advance as restrictions.
8588,I am sad that the Sundae cart went away.
8589,They do not serve anything from Houston to Corpus Christi!. Short flight!.
8590,Its not ok to have just ice cream as a desert espeically not at the end of September when its not even warm for it.
8591,Only one drink was served.
8592,"I was intrigued by the pancakes with berry ""ragout..."". Very tasty, sufficient for me, though I can understand people wanting seconds!. Unusual offering, but in my opinion, a keeper!. Inspired me to make a ""berry"" ragout at home."
8593,"I messed up, I received a complimentary meal and it was excellent. I had pre ordered it [meal]."
8594,"I had to ask for wine and was initially told it [wine] was not included in the premium cabin. When I asked again, she checked and said yes it was included but that was near the end of the 8 hour flight."
8595,Fish entree was so so!. Ok!. It is airline food!.
8596,Charge for snacks?. That is not acceptable.
8597,Both snacks - stroopwafel and Biscoff - are really nice. It would have been nice to have something more substantial in 1st class.
8598,Hot tea.
8599,no.
8600,Portions are small. we had a snack and two meals.
8601,Was not impressed with the food.
8602,"the same meal on the outbound flight as the return flight, not very tasty."
8603,Flavored seltzers would be nice.
8604,Entree was not up to what I typically experience on United First.
8605,Water was the beverage offered.
8606,In first class all we were offered was the standard pretzels and cookies. I would think that at a minimum we should have been offered a snack box or something better.
8607,They did not have coke zero like normal. pretzel bags really small.
8608,n/a.
8609,Ok.
8610,Only had choice of Chicken or a vegetarian.
8611,Yummy.
8612,"I am amazed to the variety of food options, the vegetarian dish I received (couscous with grilled vegetables) was delicious. I saved the pretzel bun to the end so I could use it to consume every bit of it. The service was precise and professional. I do not deserve this much respect."
8613,There should be more vegan options. everyone can eat!.
8614,Preflight drinks of customer's choosing should be reimplemented. A drink should be offered before meal service.
8615,Did not have the meal I preordered.
8616,Nope.
8617,OK EXPERIENCE.
8618,Main issue is with a connecting flight and outbound. inbound only two options is limited and inevitably causes duplication which is pretty boring.
8619,Na.
8620,thank you and your staff for the service.
8621,Nope.
8622,The selection or options is getting quite stale.
8623,One comment about the receipt for the online purchase - I received an email but it did not mention the cost of the item. I had to go online to get the receipt. the app did not work. I also wanted to check if I got the United Explorer Card 25% discount. I have been unable to find out.
8624,No way to pay. Credit card had to be loaded before flight?. No mention of this before flight.
8625,It was so limited.No salty snacks.
8626,It was great!.
8627,Breakfast was awful. Fish for dinner was fine -.
8628,"i thought the choice for snacks was ok at best but it would not stop me from booking United again. very minor ""complaint""."
8629,Thanks!.
8630,Breakfast meal does not offer any hot dish option.
8631,Kinda stingy on the waffle cakes.
8632,"The flight attendant told me beer or wine, did not know I could choose other alcohol beverages or drinks (I have trouble sleeping on planes)."
8633,The food and beverage selections seem to be better than your competition.
8634,No.
8635,None.
8636,The crew were remarkable and were helpful with passengers.
8637,Was a great experience!.
8638,On both outbound and inbound flights food exceeded expectations both for service and taste.
8639,Everything was great on this flight.
8640,No.
8641,I would have liked some complementary snacks.
8642,Not enough room. Dropped plastic-ware and needed to ask both people next to me to help get them back. The meal trays were all smooth and slid all over. A ridge or backing would help a lot. No place for a beverage with the meal tray on the seat. Ridiculous.
8643,Wonderful.
8644,no.
8645,Making the wifi more user friendly would help.
8646,Food was very spicy way too spicy. Not bad but could it been less added.
8647,The good was heated too long it [good] had a burnt taste.
8648,Snack should be little more.
8649,Good vegetarian choice.
8650,Aircraft was late at the gate after maintenance. the cabin service was hastely put together. Not up to the usual Business Class experience on the Denver to LHR leg.
8651,The wine served in 1st class is pretty awful. And why is the white wine always a below average oaky Chardonnay?. There are many inexpensive but perfectly drinkable wines on the market. Someone at United should really look into it.
8652,"The overall experience was okay, at best."
8653,The food exceeded my expectations.
8654,I really do not think any service is required for flights under 2 hours.
8655,"The 2nd 'meal' that was served, before the end of the flight, was a cheeseburger that was terrible."
8656,There were no pretzels just a beverage. Need a little food.
8657,It was not clear if we were being charged for these items since we were asked to provide a card for purchases before the flight took off.
8658,Need a gluten-free option.
8659,"I found a bit weird that the beverages were served when I was about to finish my meal in the evening. It would have been nice if the beverage options included different types of beer (e.g., APA/IPA). And last, but not least, the breakfast (one small yoghurt and a single biscotti) was a bit too light."
8660,No.
8661,Only two choices.
8662,Spirits charge is a bit high.
8663,The food is not good.
8664,"I did not like the scramble eggs mixed with the minced chicken sausage, I enjoy the sausage as a whole, separate from the scramble eggs. I prefer the bread roll and croissant warm not very cold. Overall, below a basic breakfast."
8665,Love the chocolate chip cookies.
8666,more beverage should be offer with snack.
8667,"short flight without meal service, but it would be nice if in First there was a snack that was more than pretzels and stroopwaffel."
8668,My waffles were delicious & hot….
8669,"I sat in my assigned seat and ordered a food box and glass of wine. (Frequently, the drinks listed in the United magazine are different than what you get.). The flight attendant was mentioning what I ordered to another flight attendant. I thought they wanted to charge me (I am Premier 1K). I had to say what my status is, and the flight attendant say, yes, buy I still need to tell her. I guess os. this transaction is very awkward. I wish there was a better way than that to make it clear that these items are complimentary rather than having to yell out my status."
8670,should offer more pre-packaged snacks. variety is better.
8671,Have flavored pretzels!.
8672,Suggest free peanuts or pretzels. Can not cost that much.
8673,"In the announcement made, the flight attendant said there would be food and beverage service. I realize that the flight was short. only beverages were offered."
8674,Needed snacks in addition to breakfast (first class).
8675,Food could be a bit tastier.
8676,I think that every airline can do better with the snack items.
8677,"I am not vegetarian, do not eat beef. the chicken was too spicy. Those were my options."
8678,"Two things about the takeoff box. The little spoon needs to come back to put the spreads into the crackers. It is the biggest Hassel without it. The Jelly that is now included is pretty meh. The double cheese spreads was significantly better. I tried to get behind the jam, but It just does not compare. The rest of it is still fantastic, best box you guys have available for sure."
8679,Should offer or give at least 2 or 3 varieties of snacks and not just one.
8680,"OK, mainly, the thing was they did not serve anything at the beginning of the flight but I *think* it was bcs. the flight was late or messed up or something. Overall, the flight attendants were stern. they clearly wanted to do a good job. I think they did."
8681,There was no such service provided.
8682,Ran out of the chicken option and only pasta option available which is overly filled with cheese;. would much prefer a vegetable option with less/no cheese.
8683,Please go back to pre-pandemic dining on United business. The tray is not fun. Having desert in a plastic container is not appealing.
8684,NO.
8685,My wife's profile lists her as gluten free yet there was no gluten free option available for her on the flight of 7.5 hours.
8686,Need more food options in first class.
8687,When we sat down and boarded no one asked us if we wanted a drink until food service.
8688,"No, complete."
8689,"More water, eg during the ""down-time"" please provide larger bottles."
8690,"Once again-- I noticed the flight attendants regularly serviced the right side of the plane. On the left side where I was sitting (22D), there was such infrequent service. Used the call attendant button twice. no one ever came. I flagged down a flight attendant to order a drink, never came. I flagged down a 2nd flight attendant to order a drink, never came."
8691,Add small snack?.
8692,"Stated in the previous q&a actually. Would have been nice to have had some snacks or alternative food options available. I have food limitations (can not eat wheat or dairy), and I understand I am a small percentage of passenger (I usually eat before my flights and / or bring my own food) but it would have been nice, had their been a fruit cup or some part of the meal that I could have eaten been offered. Perhaps a bridge too far…."
8693,Not all the options in the menu were available for breakfast.
8694,I had the sparkling wine. I think you can do a better tasting (champagne/Prosecco) at the same price point. It was very yeasty tasting.
8695,No.
8696,The snack offered (cheese/ &chicken) sandwich - nothing else and quite small considering time between dinner and time it was offered.
8697,I understand that you like to serve drinks in glasses in first class. I would have rather had the can and a glass of ice. It would be great if customers would be given both.
8698,Best food and dessert ever on a flight.
8699,"given a 4 1/2 flight, i think snack portion should be bigger. Perhaps a slider size sandwich."
8700,The choice of wines and spirits is considered good.
8701,"The flight was 2.5 hours and I the announcement said there would be adult beverages for purchase, which I have experienced before on this flight and expected. But when the cart came through I asked for a purchase and was told they were only serving soda, juice, coffee, which seemed strange for this route and the length of the flight. Friendly flight attendant came back later and had ""found"" a bottle of wine, which was very thoughtful. Maybe they just did not stock the plane or something?. Seemed odd. I do not need to drink on the flight, but was looking forward to a single beverage to relax in transit with my book."
8702,The food could be better. It was a little plain...and the tomato puree you serve is not that good. I would rather have had ketchup.
8703,I received free wine being 1K. I purchased wine for my wife who was traveling with me.
8704,Offer Monster and charge 4.50.
8705,I get it on limiting coach passengers to 2 drinks. I usually fly First Class and that is not the case.
8706,So happy they had Coke Zero.
8707,Recycling is a must!.
8708,No.
8709,I like.
8710,Food was not very good. Did not eat the entree just ate fruit and bread.
8711,It is boring.
8712,Offer more snack options.
8713,Just fine.
8714,I would like Johnny Walker Black. There were no food choices.
8715,The waffle cookie did not have much flavor.
8716,Need more selections.
8717,Enjoyed the meal.
8718,No.
8719,would like free snack bags offered in economy.
8720,"The vegetable curry with rice was the best meal I have ever had on an airplane. Unfortunately, being lactose intolerant, I could not use the butter or eat the ice cream."
8721,The coffee was weak. Wine was a nice surprise. Vegetarian “breakfast” not very good. the curry for dinner was alright but saw regular dinners had better dessert. Yogurt for desert?. Breakfast fruit was good but again the yogurt?. To select vegetarian meals it seemed inevitable that you thought I asked for vegan.
8722,"Giving out beverages twice in 12 hours (including an hour on board pre flight) is not enough, when the passengers are not allowed to bring liquids at all."
8723,Wish there wee more snack selections and larger snacks.
8724,Every healthy option offers yogurt. Not everybody likes yogurts. I had to pick the tiny red peppers out of the eggs. Why not offer a full fruit plate?.
8725,I always fly United and I have never been disappointed in any of the meals I have had.
8726,"I like the fact that they give you a can of the drinks. This cuts down on having to ask for additional drinks, and does not make you have to rush your drink."
8727,No.
8728,The snacks are very small. Other than that you guys are great.
8729,I would have liked them to offer a snack like a biscoff or pretzels.
8730,Food options generally do not appeal to me.
8731,can not afford to eat.
8732,The pretzels served on the flight from PHL to Denver on 9/9 were stale.
8733,Two or three packages of cookies is what should be given per person.
8734,NO.
8735,Spirits should be free on long haul flights.
8736,"Left at 9:55. Should have had sandwich for lunch and pasta meal later. My chicken pasta had a tiny piece of chicken while my husband got a larger piece. Less pasta, more veggies please."
8737,Food was the best I have ever had on a flight.
8738,More variety.
8739,Giving that kind of a small cookie and a soda not even a full can is very disrespectful.
8740,Difficult to hear what stewards are saying. You have screenshots available for each passenger why do not you use this to communicate. It would allow passengers to be more relaxed and ready to quickly respond back to stewards.
8741,"No food snacks (egg pretzels stroopwafels, etc. ) other flights on same route I have been offered snacks."
8742,What food??.
8743,The chicken was spicy.
8744,The flight time was only 20 minutes so it did not come up.
8745,There was no fruit offered with breakfast. I was disappointed. Loved that you started the sundaes again!!!!!!. Wish they were back to the homemade ones though.
8746,No.
8747,Coffee was not made had to wait for it and it was cold when I got it [Coffee].
8748,None.
8749,Should have a low carb meal.
8750,My soon ask for an extra bag of pretzels attendant said could not do it. I know the corporate answer if we give it to one then everyone would want two. I flew United round trip to Colorado due to your service. And you could not give him one extra bag os pretzels that you pay a dime for. Foul.
8751,There was no snack offered on the flight from Houston to Birmingham.
8752,seemless.
8753,"The food selection was not very good. The cheese plate was not a good 'dinner' choice--not much food. And I had the exact same cheese plate as a breakfast option on a subsequent flight?. Again, not a very good choice. Ok as a snack, but not a meal."
8754,No.
8755,Tv and charging ports did not work. If tv did not work should have offered free or discounted Wi-Fi.
8756,No.
8757,I would have preferred honey for my tea instead of sugar. honey was not available.
8758,The comment was actually about the ORD to MUC portion of our trip. The food was heated up with a plastic foil on top which made it taste of plastic. Ew.
8759,Very hard to cut chicken in small space.
8760,Be on time!.
8761,Would be nice to have a pre-departure drink in first class.
8762,"Too short of a flight, did not purchase or consume anything."
8763,My pretzels were stale.
8764,"For the first time ever, I received almost too much vodka in my drink. I also had tried to pre order my meal on the app and could not get it to work. I ended up having to eat the same meal on my return flight that I had eaten on my initial flight. It was the only choice I was given."
8765,The glass of water is a joke!. At least with a Coke you get 12 oz. Pretzels were stale. Threw away.
8766,"short flight, not applicable."
8767,Food is not bad but choices obscure.. how about a simple meat and potatoes/rice option and standard veggie option instead of Mexican or some weird curry. Pay attention to what people choose and make your choices from there.
8768,"Please, give more time to eat and enjoy the food. It was like you had to swallow everything in a rush. we still had hours of flight pending."
8769,no.
8770,I was confused about the food/ snacks on board. It was not offered to me at all.
8771,Coke was cold. I got a full can.
8772,N/A.
8773,Impressed with the quality.
8774,No.
8775,You should have a bigger selection.
8776,No.
8777,Pleasantly surprised.
8778,No.
8779,For an eight hour flight and for $1275 per person with me purchasing 2 tickets round-trip. Just a snack is not sufficient. a hot meal must be included. I spoke to several other passengers who felt the same.
8780,I understand the scarcity situation. But $4 bag of tiny chips on a 6 hour is a little bit Spartan. I chose to bring my own sustenance.
8781,Need a better beer selection In business/ 1st class the stewards came around only once during a 61/2 hour flight to take drink orders. Act putout if you ask for more. Other airlines I have travel came around multiple times to ask if we wanted more.
8782,Ran out of pancakes in beginning of service served water out of large bottle in cup instead of bottle not acceptable at that price.
8783,"Of course, the food needs to be packaged and available for large quantities.. I just wish there was more healthy unprocessed options. Salad, grilled vegetables, fruit, Greek yogurt, oatmeal, etc."
8784,The snack portion was not enough.
8785,"On flight from New Orleans to San Francisco, there was no ice served with the cool water. Food was not offered to purchase. We were given cookies and pretzels only."
8786,The warm chocolate chip cookie offered was super.
8787,Food was better than expected but that is a low bar.
8788,"Need to think about even something like lasagna, London broil. Chicken is getting to be a bore."
8789,"No, we were given a complimentary snack pack and a glass of champagne. My husband is a WWll veteran and l am his almost 88 year old wife and total caregiver. He will be 97 years old on October 3rd, and we have been married over 66 years!."
8790,United is expensive we should be getting full size snacks.
8791,food very good. wine needs to be upgraded. a card with available selections needs to be handed out.
8792,The hamburger was served hot and it was very good.
8793,Why did you stop selling the trail mix?. Good satisfying snack and good quality.
8794,"Although satisfactory, food is a real comedown from the good quality in business class from years ago. I miss Pan Am which I flew regularly to Geneva."
8795,The dinner was very good. the breakfast in Polaris was not especially good.
8796,Offer sandwiches.
8797,"I would like to see the fruit on the side replaced with a salad. Looking around me, it seems most folks did not eat it. Other than that, all the food was great!."
8798,Packaging VERY hard to open. They need to make it with the “Tear here” type of “cutouts” or something similar.
8799,Yes they skipped right over our row!. So we did not get anything to drink. It is not a big deal but hey it is nice to have a little coffee or something to pass the time.
8800,As I boarded I saw a tray full of already poured OJ etc. So everyone who walked thru the plane entry was basically breathing on those beverages. Ugh.
8801,"Need to improve the food, it is not very tasty. It [food] used to be good."
8802,No. Beverage service/ food was adequate.
8803,Selections and portions small and snacks are lack luster.
8804,The variety is extremely limited. I heard that some passengers wanted to purchase food. there were no more entrées left.
8805,"After a 7 hr delay, it was nice to get something."
8806,No.
8807,No.
8808,More coffee would have been good.
8809,"The first meal was chicken and rice. It was very good. The lunch meal was not good at all.. Think you can do better, and upgrade your food.. The food was hot. I was thankful to have gluten free."
8810,Do not run our!. (Which happened on this flight).
8811,no.
8812,FOOD (all choices) was disgusting. Could only eat a cookie for a 7 1/2 flight to Ireland <🤮><🤮><🤮><🤮>. Multiple of us was disgusted airline food was still that BAD. For the price of a ticket you would think any of the choices for dinner and breakfast would be etible but all of them were gross.
8813,Consider improving the food for purchase choices please.
8814,"Two flight attendants for the entire coach section???. I might have ordered a paid for snack, but goodness, there were no explanations of what was available and no time to ask the rushed attendant."
8815,Great flight.
8816,Everything was good.
8817,"With the recent increase in ""air rage"" incidents I understand the motivation for the ""one at a time"" policy for alcoholic beverages. Given the limited number of beverage services, I feel that ""two at a time"" (perhaps for just the first service) would lead to a more relaxed flying experience, but of course safety takes priority."
8818,Preorder of food was great.
8819,"Wanted white wine, but they ran out."
8820,No thanks.
8821,not enough food selections for purchase and the one listed was not available.
8822,No.
8823,"Snacks were noted on the app for the flight, so before we purchased sandwiches for the flight I checked with the gate and they did not know if it was a meal or a snack, and that they would let us know. It was getting close to boarding so we went ahead. bought sandwiches just in case. Right before we boarded we found out that there would be a meal choice but we had already bought our sandwiches so we did not really need them."
8824,More options please!.
8825,"I wish the champagne offered to purchase was better quality. Also, curious when y’all stop serving all free snacks?. What is the actual cost of that for y’all?. $0.40?!. Quite disappointing."
8826,Why NO Carryon allowed for my ticket - Some of the passengers had Carryon with them. I had to pay $35.00 & I had to check in my carryon. I used to always have one Carryon Free.
8827,Would have wished for more lo-cal choices.
8828,Not like the old days.
8829,everything was great.
8830,"Sorry , there is no going back to correct an answer in this survey (you might want to fix that, 2/5 for the people doing the survey). I thought it was about the whole flight SMF to MAD. SMF to SFO is a 45 minute flight. I am not even sure there was a beverage but if so I did not need it."
8831,Like diet Dr Pepper.
8832,There were not any Tapas boxes for sale. I was in the front of the plane so they did not run out. The other 2 options are not nearly as good.
8833,I am YC would be nice to have some real food options not only the snack boxes.
8834,"Expand categories, like alcohol."
8835,Good selection.
8836,We were 4 th row of business class (full fair). No choices left had to take what is left.
8837,Enjoyed the chicken diner - breakfast sandwich was not good.
8838,"we thought there was plenty of food, delivered warm, and surprisingly good!."
8839,thanks for the sparkling water.
8840,Gluten free options would be nice.
8841,No.
8842,Coke Zero please.
8843,We have travelled with United for many years. the food today in Business first is not up to the standards before Covid.
8844,I sat in 5a and the meal I would choose was unavailable. The only in-flight snacks were chips and one type of chocolate. Looks like I need to bring a food pack with me.
8845,"Also, the lunch service was served so late that I only had 5 minutes to eat a cheeseburger before having my plate cleared for landing--not sure why that happened when the flight was nearly 10 hours. The lounge in Rome was awful. I think it was called Prima Vista right by our gate E41 at FCO. It was terrible food and service and WAY below the standard for the Polaris class tickets we bought for our 25th anniversary."
8846,"Feels like there should be something offered on this flight, even though it is short. Pretzels only?. Bottles of water only?."
8847,While the wine selection was OK (the Meritage my husband had was excellent ) I had only one glass of champagne and then only cava was available. That was disappointing.
8848,First choice meal was not available on both legs of the trip. Food quality especially for a business class flight was mediocre at best.
8849,No nothing all good.
8850,"The hot meal was quite good….. Thai curry with rice, the salad was fresh."
8851,4 hour flight with no food except pretzels or crackers. Very disappointing.
8852,It was a short flight. the food/beverages were good.
8853,"Given the late hour of the flight, I generally order the cheese plate. It would be nice if there was a slightly augmented cheese / snack plate as an option to full entrees."
8854,Not even water on the flight to SFO.
8855,"Short flight, did not have anything."
8856,Offer Green Tea.
8857,Understood it is just too short a flight. None expected.
8858,"On the flight over in FC the man next to me had noodles delivered that were so cold and hard he could not put a fork through it - your food is basically inedible - take a flight even on air China , or ANY airline and see what food served could be."
8859,Could you make the warm chocolate cookie a bit bigger?. Please?.
8860,"On a six-hour flight that departed at 1800, there are really no more substantial offerings than a box of crackers with hummus?. I would willingly pay for something better than that."
8861,The flight attendants should be offering upgraded snacks/beverages to Global Services passengers. I am never asked if I would like a complimentary spirit or wine. upgraded snack when I travel in coach. This is a missed opportunity to support your Global Service passengers.
8862,No.
8863,Wonderful.
8864,Best airline food ever.. the cheese ravioli on flight from Cancun to SFO…as good as the ones I make.
8865,Not offered.
8866,"It was chicken or ""impossible meatballs"", whatever that is. But the chicken was very good!."
8867,No.
8868,More vegetarian options. Please only serve hot food. The temperature in the cabin is very low. Need hot food to keep warm.
8869,wanted diet ginger ale or sprite. neither availabl. e I was in row 45 so only one choice available by the time they got to me.
8870,Good quality food. Almost a complete meal.
8871,Due to flight delay my meal dried out and was not as tasty as other times that I have chosen the same item.
8872,Why were orange juice and grapefruit juice not offered?.
8873,I think there needs to be a Diet Sprite/7-Up equivalent. Something with neither sugar nor caffeine in that genre.
8874,Hot.
8875,Fish entree was cooked to death. portion was very small. Breakfast options (brioche cheeseburger or roast veg with couscous) are both completely unappetizing. I heard a lot of negative comments about these from other passengers too. Both items should be rotated out in favor of a more traditional breakfast selection.
8876,I am just glad you all still do a free beverage. I get the full can of soda. Really nice.
8877,Improve the quality of food provided.
8878,It used to be that on s cross-country flight. a free meal was served. Flights have not gotten less expensive. the free meals have been replaced by food for pay.
8879,Offer something other than yogurt that people can choose from.
8880,Better variety of snacks.
8881,Pretzels were stale.
8882,A snack would be good.
8883,More options.
8884,No.
8885,no.
8886,No food or beverage was served because it was a short flight. There is no option to select N/A.
8887,No.
8888,Would have like to champagne and not Preseco on the flights.
8889,Very nice crew.
8890,Fix ya damn TVs.
8891,None.
8892,More variety.
8893,"I wish you had an option for just 'meh'. It is okay, not great. And took many grains. Would like more of a salad. In general, good enough when I am not flying business class. I definitely missed that this flight."
8894,N/A.
8895,Sparkling wine not very good.
8896,was not offered any food.
8897,You should have additional qty of Lunch/Dinner menu for customers that did not have time to purchase food due to connecting flights.
8898,"As I said earlier, the food from London to Denver was better than the food Denver to London."
8899,"They ran out of every beer except Coors/Bud. I prefer tequila for spirits. which is not offered, so I stuck with wine."
8900,no.
8901,No.
8902,Better selection of food in First Class.
8903,On such a long fight it would be nice if they came around to see if you wanted anything else to drink.
8904,No.
8905,Not enough milk.
8906,Healthy vegetarian options would be much appreciated.
8907,"I had the Chicken Zaatar dish. Although the serving crockery with foil cover gave the assumption that it would be heated, this plane did not have an oven so it was served cold. Rather than being a detractor, i found the dish even more satisfying served cold. The flavors seemed more prevalent and the chicken more juicy than would have been if it had been unceremoniously heated to death. I commented to our flight attendant that it was one of the best meals I have had on a flight in quite some time."
8908,Nothing else.
8909,No.
8910,dna.
8911,"The in-flight magazine said we would be offered a single malt scotch (Glenfarcas). I was given Cutty Sark. Not a big deal, but you asked. Also, the flight attendants are never quite sure what the ""pasta dish"" really us. So we usually just take the chicken."
8912,I asked for a pretzel and cookie. My flight was delayed. I was hungry. The flight attendant gave me water no ice and only one snack.
8913,"I was not even offered any water. The plane was cramped. the PA was so garbled I could not hear the announcements. We landed safely, that is all that matters."
8914,Light snack.
8915,No.
8916,At least there should be some water or juice for the flight. Only saw those on sale.
8917,Snack would be nice on a long flight.
8918,Bummer that you are now charged for snacks. But the $0 change fee for flight changes makes up for it.
8919,"The choices seem very limited. I have noticed things like the bistro burger and the fruit and cheese tray listed as snacks that are sometimes available, but I have never seen these on any flights (and I travel very often- I am premier 1K). I would love to see these options offered more frequently. My beverage of choice, sparkling wine, was not available on this flight either. The flight attendant looked very hard to find it for me, but she could not come up with it."
8920,We were suppose to receive snack boxes on our trip for being 1k but they were not even offered?.
8921,Besides of 2 kinds of meal chicken & lasagne. Hope to have one more choice of selection.
8922,Would be nice yo have sandwiches for flights longer than 1 hour.
8923,Can you serve water bottles instead of a cup of water. I was really thirsty.
8924,No.
8925,The breakfast was not really a breakfast just a yoghurt.
8926,"I would have ordered but brought a drink, thinking a short flight would not offer food or drink."
8927,"I do not particularly have problems with the food I am only thing the United for be good company take care more food allergies serious,like no peanut in the plane or in some area."
8928,"For flights offering first class, maybe have flight attendants have training on crafting cocktails."
8929,More healthy salad options please.
8930,We really appreciate the food on those long flights - it really helps!. And it is pretty good !. The sticky toffee ice cream is delicious!. The little salad with israeli couscous is pretty good too along with the warm turkey and cheese on a roll served as a snack.
8931,No.
8932,Good job.
8933,United needs to get better food and more choices. It is the same menu every flight. There is only one item I would consider and its not that great. Serve a side salad with the chicken entre please.
8934,More options please.
8935,no.
8936,No Manu vegetarian options. The taste of the food was weird.
8937,Better tasting OJ.
8938,there were no snacks.
8939,"I was in Business Class, and only got a complimentary champagne and two small saltines."
8940,Seats are very uncomfortable and narrow with very limited legroom. Paying $50 additional charge is not an option. United Airline ticket is too expensive to be this uncomfortable.
8941,Would like more flavor in the food.
8942,disappointed with the quality of food.
8943,It would be nice to have a sandwich or lighter for lunch.
8944,No beef offering.
8945,More of a selection.
8946,"When I booked the flight I requested gluten sensitive. I thought it said not available. So I brought some food from home. I was surprised when the flight attendant gave me my meal. The meal was good. the sandwich at the end of the flight was interesting. I can not say it was good, but it was not bad. Not sure what it was. the package was in Italian. Maybe cheese and artichoke???. according to the picture."
8947,No pretzels or cookies anymore?. I wish I would have known. I do not think that is a good idea. there is no option to buy them. I think that needs to be re-thought.
8948,Should offer pretzels to all passengers Not just first class.
8949,The flight attendant should offer the whole can of sprite with ice and provide more snacks. Other airlines like American Airlines provide more snacks and give the whole can of soda instead of a cup.
8950,"nothing in the Tapas box to spread the cheese with, I think it [cheese] used to include a spreader."
8951,No ice. No snack.
8952,many people who ordered kosher food were not given such food.
8953,Protein available w/ or with o fee.
8954,All was ok and it was a full flight but there was no offer for a second beverage.
8955,Flight attendant forgot our meal. only one option (veggie) was left over. In general portions were very small.
8956,no.
8957,No.
8958,I like the food overall. The chicken was a little spicy. The dessert was good. (Correction).it was a cookie. The roll was really good and the fruit. Overall the meal was really good. Thank you.
8959,Business class - no snack was offered. Complimentary meal choices were too ethnic. I got the chicken which was too highly seasoned. Thought about getting the burger but glad I did not when I saw how it looked.
8960,I wish I could get the whole can of soda.
8961,Recommend increase snacks portion.
8962,Appreciate having the entire can of beverage.
8963,Flight was not stocked well enough to provide the requested first glass of wine to the first class cabin.
8964,I personally did not care for the dish I ordered. It was very spicy;. to spicy for me.
8965,Quality of white wine needs improvement and offer a larger selection of beers.
8966,"did not like having to put my credit card in my app first. did not get to do it onboard, did not drink much purchased booze."
8967,Received a drink at the beginning of the meal. no one followed up to ask if I wanted anything else (business class).
8968,Good flight.
8969,The water I got was a very small cup. Would like to have either a much larger glass or at least half a bottle of water. I feel like I got a 1/4 of a bottle of water.
8970,"Should have an ingredient list available,& a healthier option."
8971,Larger portions would be nice.
8972,Snacks would be a cool edition to United.
8973,No.
8974,I would like to have toast with my eggs.
8975,Dinner was tasty!.
8976,Change it up guys.
8977,1. I would like a diet and caffeine free soda -- like diet sprite!;. 2. last night they had only two buyable snack pack options by the time they got to my row.
8978,Chicken was dry and had unappetizing seasoning.
8979,Should offer snacks.
8980,No.
8981,It would be nice to offer more of a variety of food items to purchase that are more healthy.
8982,"Menu for drinks would be helpful, selected meals not available both times."
8983,Ice cream was defrosted. as a result I had the runs halfway through flight from Berlin to Newark.
8984,please offer a decent cabernet on all flights in first class.
8985,"Just think that a beverage should be offered preflight, especially when there is time to do it."
8986,Just need some electrolytes.
8987,No.
8988,"Yes- offer a variety of snacks on the flight. Jetblue has many options which are good, and United should do the same. Also, it would be nice to get multiple snacks instead of one. I noticed this happens on every United flight."
8989,We had several choices but only one option - ran out of the other choices.
8990,Option of vegetables to accompany the meal. Flavors seemed a bit off and carb heavy.
8991,The vegan meat ball dish was excellent.
8992,No.
8993,Champaña.
8994,Just need better quality and selection as your prices increase for first class.
8995,No.
8996,None.
8997,It would be nice to know food choices prior to flight. Calorie or other info so we could make choices ahead or without the stuadess answering same questions over and over.
8998,If water is served from cups the amount should be larger.
8999,Provide some healthy snack. The cookies and pretzels are loaded with bad ingredients.
9000,It was wonderful to be asked what to eat ahead of time and ordering seemed easy until I got on the plane and my choice was not there for me. I do have dietary restrictions in allergies they did the best they could to accommodate me. I was disappointed.
9001,We were told it was a no snack flight.
9002,Quite happy with the experience.
9003,Veggie dish needs more flavor.
9004,I am a diabetic and celiac. A packet of potato chips would have been a nice snack for me. Cookies are not okay. Sitting in 2 b I would expect.
9005,Dinner main was tasty in Premium plus. Breakfast was average. Good snacks to choose from. I choose a biscuit (cookie).
9006,Red wine very cold.
9007,No.
9008,nothing was served. short flight. my feedback concerns the long flight from Baltimore to San Francisco. only one package of Biscoff during a 5 hour flight?.
9009,Should have a proper lunch on an 8 hour flight that departs at 10 and lands after 2.
9010,Difficulty in using the United App to pay for things.
9011,I am lactose intolerant. have had to skip breakfast every single time because Yogurt makes me throw up. A simple French bread with butter is simple and a whole lot better.
9012,The food was good seemed fresh Also the coffee is better than it used to be.
9013,Absolutely the only thing unsatisfactory for that long flight from SFO to SYD was the wine. It was really terribly disappointing (alleged to have been chardonnay).
9014,Attendants in coach were slow to respond to call buttons and were forgetful of customer requests.
9015,No.
9016,Main meal average. Very strange flavor.
9017,"The pop was served in a warm can with just a little ice in a cup that melted very fast. Again, this was first class and was offered nothing special compared to regular class. They only came around once to offer anything. I asked for water also and was given a warm water bottle."
9018,I would purchase food on every flight. your variety & selected pacs SUCK. I do not know who selects what is in the snack packs but whom ever it might be needs to be replaced.
9019,As usual they bring filled glass. I do not know what I am drinking. They never offer second round.
9020,There were only 2 options—beef or chicken.
9021,It is a short flight. maybe 1 beverage and snack could be served.
9022,"Once again, between takeoff and drink service there is always a very long wait on United. Instead of serving a beginning cocktail, each passenger in business class must wait until the court comes around which means that the last person that the court gets to might wait 2+hours after takeoff to get a drink. This is quite different than other airlines."
9023,Waffle was delicious!. Too long interval between meals.
9024,Flight attendants were not familiar with the beverage options outlined in the inflight magazine. We were told our selection was not available. later we saw other passengers in our section receive the beverage we had selected. This is especially disturbing because we were requesting a scotch whisky on a flight originating from Scotland...
9025,Gluten free option missing.
9026,Nope.
9027,no.
9028,No.
9029,I am both gluten free and vegetarian. the GF meals always include meat. I have not found a way to note in my profile that I am both gluten free and vegetarian.
9030,Please do not serve that silly pack of pretzels and cookie. Or at least offer 2 packets.
9031,No free snack not even a pretzel!!.
9032,Portion sizes had definitely bee reduced since befor pandemic. But still fine. People eat fro much anyway.
9033,The beverage was actually free.... not many other airlines are doing this now.
9034,could have had some pretzels crackers cookies.
9035,You should add apple juice!.
9036,More serving.
9037,Wish there was more selections or a pre-order selection added to United.
9038,The main chicken dish was good. the salad was so-so.
9039,Better snack.
9040,Something more substantial than the bag of nuts.
9041,"I would like to have the option of the brioche burger, or something similar."
9042,No wine in short flights is not nice when you scared of flying.
9043,gave me 3/4 ice and a dash of ginger ale.
9044,Short flight and food not available. Enjoyed glass of champagne.
9045,Same snacks as always. It would be nice to have less sugary snacks. Some protein bars. Or a piece of fruit. It is a long flight. A bottle of water would be nice.
9046,"on my flight to Boston, I received an e-mail to pre order my meal. On the return flight to Chicago, I did not and was not able to find where this was on the Web site. So I selected food on plane. Only options were vegetarian meatballs and spicy chicken. I would have loved an option for some kind of salad instead."
9047,"Frankly, the coffee is just not strong enough. Pretzels are just dry. I am happy that there are more low cal/nonsweet beverages available such as the AHA drinks."
9048,"I was offered the chance to pre-order my meal, which I did. However, within 24 hours, I received an email from United stating that the pre-order was a mistake and my order was cancelled. It did not matter as it happens as I was able to get the meal I had requested. I also thought that the wine selection was somewhat limited and we were not offered a pre-take off drink.."
9049,I would have liked a couple more drinks but they did not come back around.
9050,"Any kind of ABQ specialty, please!."
9051,No.
9052,"No, everything was fine."
9053,Just THANK YOU for offering beverages AND a little snack (pretzels and/or cookies).
9054,"The food was not appetizing. Overcooked chicken, plastic fruit cup, dense bread."
9055,Is there a way to request a gluten free meal/snack for my fight?. Is there an extra charge?. I appreciated that the brownie everyone got was gluten free.
9056,This was the tastiest food at United.
9057,snack portion size small - could have had more ( it do hit the spot ).
9058,Water was not offered enough.
9059,no.
9060,No.
9061,"Yes, root beer would be a nice beverage."
9062,They can have little better quality whiskey and should be give two given two drinks if asked They give you one and then never comeback for second as they promised It happens a lot lately as I always travel United.
9063,"my one comment on the snacks is it would be nice if one were gluten free. GF troop waffles are made, but also just potato or corn chips would work and they would not be expensive."
9064,No coffee available on flight.
9065,Hamburger served second service. Not very good. Bun was hard.
9066,No.
9067,No.
9068,"need to feed Economy seats a meal on long flights , not just rich people."
9069,Do a better job with the dessert. Heat the rolls. The pre-arrival snack was very good.
9070,I think that the beverage should be a full can. i guess only if you are consuming alchol. That is what I observed.
9071,"For this flight, it [flight] used to be a meal."
9072,Good experience.
9073,1st Class gave offered a meal selection of the flight which I was very good.
9074,No.
9075,Presentation was as good as it could be considering the environment. Overall far better quality and taste than we expected.
9076,Beef was horrible.
9077,We actually got 2 meals in the flight. They were included in the fare.
9078,The online pre-registration offered no vegan option. Very frustrating. Tried to contact United online - no response. Thankfully the crew found solutions for us..
9079,Very glad you had Buffalo Trace.
9080,They ran out of dinners to serve !.
9081,It was nice to be welcomed with a glass of champagne!. On the flight to Athens nothing was offered when came aboard.
9082,No.
9083,Food in the United Club was quite good and fresh.
9084,"Iced tea, green tea, sparkling water (not soda)."
9085,No.
9086,Tortollini lunch was excellent…exceeded my expectations!. Snack pocket sandwich was nothing special.
9087,The only thing I like to add is that we were also served a sandwich as a snack since it was an 8 hr flight. I think it would have been nice to pair the sandwich with a side like chips.
9088,Hate the need to pay extra but appreciate the app and its warning to pay ahead.
9089,"I was surprised and disappointed that they only gave a cup of soda, not a can."
9090,the food was not good. The sandwich was mostly bread and cold. the breakfast was very small. there was no variety.
9091,The food was better from SFO to Tel Aviv than Tel Aviv to SFO. The salmon with pasta in cream sauce I could not eat (and I am not very picky). The salmon had a metallic taste. the pasta was a dry goo.
9092,Offer complimentary snack like. nuts ir pretzels.
9093,no complimentary snack;. why the inconsistency?. (IAH to CVG did provide snack).
9094,Maybe a light meal should be offered due to it being a late flight. This was not a deal breaker.
9095,No.
9096,Offer second.
9097,Appreciate the 1K snack/bev policy.
9098,No Diet Pepsi.
9099,There needs to be more frequent rotation of meal choices.
9100,It took 1 1/2 to get anything to drink. Too long. Food was gross.
9101,Lower prices.
9102,"Was not offered water for a few hours, was very thirsty."
9103,Most of the things I like.
9104,No snacks offered.
9105,More variety.
9106,Snack or other food was not served.
9107,Great that coffee was complimentary.
9108,"Given that a single vodka is so small, it would be nice if ordering two at a time (vs only one) was a standard option."
9109,"The chicken had a good flavor and the portion size was adequate, but it was very tough and hard to eat. This could have been a fluke as I have never had that issue before."
9110,There was no service of food or beverages. They served nothing!.
9111,No one flys for food and beverage.
9112,Nothing was served.
9113,The choices were chicken and quinoa or vegetables. The taste was not satisfactory.
9114,Really liked the ability to pre-order.
9115,"It would be nice to have the whole can of soda or juice, plus pretzels or cookies."
9116,For me simplify the product with spices and garnishes as sides so the product is simplified.
9117,No. As expected from previous flights.
9118,"On my return flight, the flight attendants were not checking all passengers to see if they wanted to purchase in flight snacks. I wanted to make a purchase. the crew was gone before I could flag them down."
9119,No snacks.
9120,No.
9121,No chips or any type of food offered for first class.
9122,I have seen the same items offered forany years. It would be good to introduce variety.
9123,I do not know if you meant by dessert the pineapple with the dinner. No other dessert was offered. I would have enjoyed a cookie along with the drink before we landed.
9124,Should give people a whole can.
9125,"No choice, just got handed pretzels."
9126,Would love to see a Sauvignon blanc on the wine list.
9127,Your airlines refusal to accept credit card payment for drinks is ridiculous.
9128,Butternut squash ravioli was disappointing because it was cheese ravioli with a few pieces of butternut squash tossed on top. Not the same thing. Cheesecake is bad and fattening and no other option.
9129,More selection of beverages.
9130,Coffee luke warm.
9131,No.
9132,Nope. I’ m happy.
9133,No.
9134,Comment is the lack of quality food options in ORD.
9135,A snack would be good.
9136,I am used to flying Hawaiian airlines and they give you a free meal— would be nice to get a complementary snack or meal….
9137,There was no food or beverage service provided.
9138,No snacks were even offered.
9139,too little.
9140,Satisfactory.
9141,Long flight for only one little cookie.
9142,Nothing.
9143,The snack boxes seem to have gone down in quality.
9144,"Hummus was old and separated, inedible."
9145,The description of the chicken dish did not indicate that it would be so very spicy. The roll was fine - would have appreciated more butter. The fresh fruit was very good as was the little muffin. I was disappointed that there was NOTHING in the morning.
9146,Thanks for the fruit and roll from the tray along with the snack box. It would be nice to have more than one white wine choice.
9147,"Water should be offered in larger bottles and more frequently, by flight attendants actively offering water, not just breezing through the cabin."
9148,Great meal and cocktails.
9149,It just was not good.
9150,"The flight attendant should put the cream in the coffee, or hand me a packet."
9151,Would have been nice to have a beef option. Otherwise ok.
9152,I said n/a on the beverages because I did not enjoy the beer but that was my own fault for ordering beer.
9153,Piri piri chicken was tasty.
9154,no.
9155,Provide different sections every quarter (3 months).
9156,Do not put the red wine on the fridge please.
9157,None served.
9158,"Even though it was a short flight. I was flying in first class seat and only received water before the flight started. No turbulence, calm flight conditions yet not services. same happened to me on a longer flight from ORD to DSM, on this day. expected more service that did not happen."
9159,They served good and healthy food.
9160,"The snack, could be more healty, less carbs and more protein or."
9161,Think it is crazy to give out cookies on 5:30 am flight.
9162,I would have liked to purchase food but was never offered anything during the 6 hr flight.
9163,"As we all know, Champagne is the name designated -and controlled by the producing locality, to the sparkling wine from the region of Champagne, France. If you are offering prosecco from Italy or cava from Spain, it should be noted. The FA kept offering champagne up and down the aisle and when I asked her which brand it was, she just shrugged and kept on her way."
9164,no.
9165,"There was no food. That is ok, I just can not rate it."
9166,Irish there were more hot food options.
9167,"About 4hours are not good without food and beverage, I needed more drinks and snacks. That’ll be fine if I got more."
9168,Overall for a business class meal I think what you offered is lacking.
9169,Probably the best airline food I ever tasted.
9170,I appreciated the variety of items in a single snack box!.
9171,"I thought that my wife would get a vegetarian meal, since we listed that as her preference, but she did not."
9172,"I only took the complementary snacks, and they were decent, especially the juice was quite enjoyable."
9173,plant milk would have been good.
9174,Bring back the real hot fudge sundae.
9175,Economy was served before 1st class. I barely had time to finish my coffee prior to landing.
9176,why why why why why are snack boxes available in the economy cabin ... (and are given free of charge to global services members in economy) ... but passengers in the first class cabin get pretzels or a stroopwafel. and that is IT. i fail to understand the logic. it is really upside down world.
9177,I think only using contactless payment is very confusing for most passengers.
9178,"I was THRILLED with the idea of pre-ordering my meal!!. This made it such a convenient way to plan for dinner, so I was looking forward to my selection!. PLEASE continue this PRE-ORDER program and PLEASE have vegetarian options like the TOFU and Cauliflower selection. IT WAS THE BEST MEAL I have had in a long time."
9179,"My first class flight attendant that served my lunch was not very friendly. She never smiled or wanted to talk when I ask her questions, was actually cold and rude."
9180,Good food.
9181,no.
9182,"The pretzels are very, very dry."
9183,"No, it was pretty basic but was fine."
9184,Great service.
9185,I did have a non-vegetarian meal as well. That was excellent.
9186,The main meal should have an appetizer.
9187,"there were no snacks offered, though they did give a full can of soda."
9188,"I am sure there is a reason since all flights do it, but I hate that the drinks are warm, then poured over ice. We end up with watered down, still warm soda. However, on a short domestic flight, anything is appreciated!."
9189,They offer some sort of a sandwich- people are always hungry. snakes are just not enough.
9190,We were not offered any food at all.<☹️>.
9191,Was expecting meal/snack on long flight to Austin.
9192,I was disappointed that we were only offered breakfast service. Lunch entrees were expected.
9193,Had requested Asian vegetarian meals. Food quality was very poor.
9194,No.
9195,None.
9196,Fish too salty;. breakfast was partly frozen with stale bagel.
9197,It would have been nice to have additional choices. Our only choice was a cheese tray.
9198,Could have had a small snack like a packet of pretzels with the water.
9199,More options.
9200,Sandwich was OK. Wine was good.
9201,No.
9202,The food on the plane is like a TV dinner. It lacks flavor and choices for a vegetarian are very limited. Austrian airline has actual restaurant quality food. I had a delicious piece of salmon with potatoes on that business class flight.
9203,I know it is a short flight. surely you can provide a modest snack in first class.
9204,enjoyed the mimosa during boarding.
9205,"see general comment: view options, mediocre quality food, poor quality wine and branded spirits, no cocktails, no true multiple course meal experience, bring back ice cream cart. (all as compared to other airlines, eg KLM, Air France, LH)."
9206,No.
9207,No.
9208,I could have use a chip or cookie or a bit of something.
9209,Preferred Milk-none available. Preferred mustard/ketchup with burger-none avail.
9210,"As said previously the 2 meal choices as shown in the Email pictures looked awful. So I went with the Snack Box, not worth it in 1st class."
9211,I like to see some food if the flight is over 3 hour.
9212,Nothing else.
9213,No snacks.
9214,No.
9215,"After turbulence, offer wet wipes to clean up spilled beverages."
9216,Please have a no food option. I never eat on the plane. hate wasted food.
9217,Option was chicken or vegetarian. Food was lukewarm and had little meat. Mostly cold quinoa.
9218,no.
9219,Excelente.
9220,"I have received emails offering to let me choose my meal in advance for several flights. So far, this has been a waste of time. My meal has been cancelled, not received. only one option is given. System seems to need some help."
9221,Please have a beverage menu to see wine options in business class.
9222,Maybe a third choice of snack.
9223,Bring back tequila and Tito's vodka as options Also the takeoff box no longer comes with something to spread the cheese and jam.
9224,No.
9225,Already gave detailed comment.
9226,"The chicken dish was poor quality and over cooked. Although I did not eat it [quality] all, I was uncomfortable from the meal on my next flight. (Over cooked vegetables, dried out sauce. Pasta was OK)."
9227,I am business class we had 4 choices. I chose a first and second. I received the second choice.
9228,Food quality was ok. The portion was ok. the chicken should be more hot. The bred was icecold and hard. The dessert was good at all just a littel too sweet but good in tast.
9229,Please drive for more sustainable packaging no plastic and minimal single use and packaged items.
9230,Warm food.
9231,The beverage variety and the sneak all over the flight were great!!. With great service. The meals were uneatable.
9232,I oils have preferred having meals offered over snacks.
9233,Need healthier options.
9234,It would be nice to have a vegan dessert with the vegan meal.
9235,Breakfast was not something I could eat. Maybe change to something more globally acceptable like a croissant or muffin.
9236,Would have liked to get the entire can.
9237,No snack.
9238,"Since we had not pre-ordered our meal (did not receive a notification to do that as we had on the outbound flight), my husband almost did not receive his first choice. And I heard the flight attendant offer a snack box to another passenger as his choice was not available. It seems a snack box should not be a choice for first class."
9239,I wish they would have given us pretzels. Crackers or some kind of snack..
9240,I can not believe that in 2022 there was no recycling of appropriate plastics and aluminum cans. Everything went into the same trash bag. It might be a pain but should still be done - esp. the aluminum. We took the plastic water bottle we purchased at the airport with us and recycled it at Dulles.
9241,UA needs to change up the food options more often. The chicken dish came with a pepper sauce on it. It was too spicy for me . Please make available the option for the sauce to be served on the side.
9242,No!.
9243,Everything was great.
9244,Waiting for regular service to return. The pandemic is over.
9245,NA.
9246,No.
9247,"When any dish is going to be spicy/hot, should be identified in advance for people who have reflux problems."
9248,RJ flight - no food expected.
9249,Great.
9250,"I love that United is offering Aha blueberry - such a great, flavorful, low calorie beverage. I only wish that hot chocolate was available too."
9251,"Could you maybe consider offering organic caffeine-free hot beverages such as peppermint, chamomile or hibiscus tea as an alternative to the caffeinated coffee and black tea?."
9252,N/A.
9253,"We did not have food and beverage service on this flight. We were told that it was due to ""perceived turbulence"" or something like that. We had no turbulence."
9254,Nothing to say.
9255,No.
9256,"The waffle and the eggs were a VAST improvement over the salt and fat bomb heated ""sandwiches"" on our last 2 flights to and from Tampa."
9257,All worked well.
9258,The cabin attendant provided a glass of water upon boarding (i was in 1st class). I do not recall her coming around to offer any liquid refreshment during the 2 hour flight. I guess I just expected at least one pass through the first class cabin during the flight to ask if i needed anything.
9259,No.
9260,the red wine ran out on our flight home.
9261,Nothing.
9262,No.
9263,It would be nice to have an almond option.
9264,"Limited choices even when pre-ordering on the app - why?. When you have a day or two notice, there should be more choices. No motivation to use the app and preorder. Also, the quality of the food could be better. I fly international so I know this is possible."
9265,Flight attendants never returned to ask if I needed something additional to drink. Particularly after breakfast needing more coffee.
9266,The complimentary meal (pasta) was very bland. The complimentary snack (small turkey and cheese sandwich) was good.
9267,I prefer more traditional meal choices.
9268,It would be nice the bread could be served hot.
9269,"I could not find a celiac order at time of reservation, or checkin. Was able to find solution, and attendants went the extra mile to find GF snacks."
9270,I was impressed with the vegan meals. I would recommend more fruit being offered as a snack.
9271,Keep it up.
9272,The pretzel were stale. The only thing I would add. I like to have my snack with my drink. I received my drink and got my snack about 20 minutes later.
9273,more choice and larger.
9274,Short Flight Nothing served.
9275,A nut or pretzel snack would be nice.
9276,Water should have been servend More during the night.
9277,No.
9278,Only watere was offered. there was no snack. We had a few bumps early but not enough to not have a snack.
9279,"I did not have a problem. However, the gentleman next to me who had ordered a vegan meal was told it was no longer available when food was being served. It seems only one vegan meal had been loaded on the plane, and that had been given to someone in first class. I think this could certainly have been handled better."
9280,The addition of a third option - Thai Vegetable Curry - to the meal choice was a real pleasant surprise. The food was good.
9281,"Fir an 11 hour flight I expected lunch and dinner meals , rather than lunch and a small snack."
9282,The dessert options were insufficient.
9283,"this fat chick in my row got on with a medium pepperoni pizza, a real medium pizza. not airport medium, and ate the whole thing and then ordered the cheese plate from the waitress."
9284,Ran out of apple juice.
9285,Very good!.
9286,The alternative meat meatballs were good. the corn succotash was okay. Maybe not my food of choice.
9287,Maybe add to the variety of complimentary snacks.
9288,I missed the beverage cart going by as I had to wait until the cart fully served everyone before I could return to my seat after using the bathroom.
9289,"You asked specifically about the dessert. It was a frozen lemon sorbet. Nothing special. But, I did not expect anything else. It is just that you asked. So since you asked and seemed important to UA, I guess I am disappointed."
9290,It is great to have vegetarian options.
9291,Several wanted Dr Pepper products.
9292,more choices of food would be nice.
9293,"My wife and I flew business class. In general the quality of business class meals/service have deteriorated especially after COVID. For example, no hot towels, typically you served nuts with first drink - that was not the case on this flight. You used to have a sundae cart. Have not brought it back. Also no menus that go over the meal/wine/etc. choices. The meal service was somewhere inbetween coach and business. Would be nice if you at least got back to a pre-COVID environment. I would even be willing to pay a little more for a better meal. although I do not think I should have to considering the cost of a business class ticket."
9294,More healthy options but in general it was good. For breakfast we had a croissant plus waffles and later more bread. I felt I had too much carbohydrates.
9295,No.
9296,None.
9297,"The large bottled white wine is way too strong, please provide more opportunities to serve water during the flight."
9298,No.
9299,Would be nice to offer a caffeine free diet pop/ soft drink . Also a different water than Dasani because they add salt to their bottled water.
9300,No.
9301,"A light snack that we did not have to pay for would have been nice. Also, the pre-paid ones did not have a great selection."
9302,I ordered Brioche Burger. It took a long time for it to heat up which made he bun a little hard but it was still tasty and filling for the long flight.
9303,Wrapped cookie in business class?.
9304,It took too long to serve the beverages and was disappointed to not get pretzels on our first flight. It is just a special little tough that we always get when flying SouthWest.
9305,Chill the champange.
9306,Have more options for snacks.
9307,That they will give us a full can of soda not just a partial.
9308,"Larger water bottles during night flight, I do not tend to sleep on planes,.and felt quite thirsty. The food on my outgoing flight was. good, and felt my appetite was fulfilled. I did not enjoy the return meal."
9309,All was fine.
9310,Seemed very appropriate for the flight.
9311,A 6 hour flight is long haul. Food should be provided free of charge on ling haul flights.
9312,Would have like if there was a utensil/napkin package in the tapas box so that I would not have to eat with my fingers.
9313,Larger portions would be very nice.
9314,More on the club lounge or lack thereof. I understand that it is under construction but what are you offering passengers that have passes?.
9315,They were delicious.
9316,Serve Canada Dry ginger ale. B.
9317,"Need new and changing food selections, seems the same for almost two years."
9318,n/a.
9319,nothing.
9320,It would be better if de-caf coffes are served.
9321,"More space, tvs for entertainment and more drinks."
9322,Good service.
9323,N/A.
9324,None was served.
9325,"FLL - HOU, breakfast, HOU - YVR, same breakfast. It really is close to a nice lunch. N.B., the quality and taste was very good and I have millions of miles."
9326,Nothing was served.
9327,No.
9328,No.
9329,No snacks only beverage.
9330,The food was not that clever had better.
9331,Gluten free alternative would be nice.
9332,not interested in eating on airplanes.
9333,Vegetarian breakfast was fruit (delicious) and chocolate chip cookies(?). Really?.
9334,"They served dinner and snack and it took almost an hour to pick them up. It was a full plane and no where to set the trash, so had to sit there for a long period of time. With the snack they never did come through to pick up the trash. I left it on the floor as I left the plane."
9335,I only had 1 glass of red wine with snack then I was informed that they ran out for my dinner glass. Your coffee was beyond terrible. Too bad.
9336,A gluten free meal option would have been nice.
9337,"The sealed pouches in the Takeoff snack are virtually impossible to open without a pointed knife or scissors. I am perfectly tactile and am familiar with opening such packages, but it took me 10 to 15 minutes to open 3,mostly using my teeth. No, there was no tab or notch. Very off-putting. Suggest discontinuing unless corrected."
9338,It would be nice if snack boxes were still available for Global Service members.
9339,We were in First class. the food was very good. the fruit was fresh. we were pleased with our selection. I like a good cup of fresh coffee.
9340,Orange juice was warm and tasted old.
9341,"My itinerary (as provided by CWT Sato Travel (Government) said there would be Lunch served on the flight. Because of that I had not gotten any food in Denver, so was surprised when there was no meal service on board;. however, when I showed the itinerary to the flight attendant. she gave me a complimentary snackbox, which I very much appreciated. I am sure my seat mates did, too, since my stomach was growling!."
9342,"Would be nice if you offered more complimentary snacks like Southwest does. If they have 2 or 3 choices, you can take all 3 if wanted instead of just choosing 1."
9343,Nn.
9344,The only option available to me was chicken curry - I did not enjoy it - do not like curry.
9345,"I believe that perhaps in trying new thinks, there are quite a few people that are not crazy about quinoa or spicy things…. I believe simple things would be best…. plus that bun with cheese and ham?. was grotesquely greasy….. there is no need for that. A plain sandwich would have hit the spot just the same."
9346,Short flight so not at this time.
9347,If I could fault the Attendants it was in the distribution of the meals. I thought they were impersonal and curt in their approach.
9348,Cup size was small. I would prefer you use cups and products manufactured in the USA and note this somewhere.
9349,No.
9350,Nice variety of beverages was served by a professional and friendly crew.
9351,Temperature was good.
9352,No.
9353,A second round of beverages would be appreciated on such a long flight.
9354,The food was really not good. It did not look appetizing or appealing. It [food] also did not taste very good.
9355,Higher quality food for not a bad price.
9356,Mango was underripe and unpalatable.
9357,I absolutely love the option to have your card on file for purchasing food. Please continue that option!.
9358,No.
9359,"As a frequent flier, there was very limited options for purchase and only 1 snack per person. On a 5 hour flight that ended up being delayed, this was disappointing."
9360,Good Selection.
9361,Would like something healthier like hummus.
9362,Better snack selection and add Pepsi.
9363,It was all very good!.
9364,Is fine.
9365,Could not preload credit card. No other options to purchase food.
9366,would have liked a snack.
9367,Good snacks. Also like that the flight attendants gave us the entire can of beverage.
9368,I accidentally said I was not served a complimentary meal. I was. I left my feedback in a prior comment.
9369,"I would appreciate the FA bringing the mild with the coffee and then allowing me to choose how much to put in my cup. I appreciated the FA bringing me two small bottles of vodka, and a full can of Cranberry juice, allowing me to then mix the two. Unfortunately, the meal I chose was not what I was served. I appreciate the ability to chose. But it seems this still has some bumps in the road that need to be worked on. The food looked as if it had been prepared many hours before. The sauce was crusted, which suggested to me that it had been sitting for hours. It tasted good. Portion size way too small. I was nicely treated to a cheese/fruit tray as the FA realized the amount of food just was not that much. Miss the nuts with early flight beverage service in First Class."
9370,"The lunch items offered contained gluten, so I needed to find an alternative. The attendant made several suggestions, and returned several times to make sure that I was satisfied with what I received."
9371,"These were very skimpy snacks for such a long flight. We were presented with a choice of two. The passenger next to me asked if she could have both. The flight attendant said, “No, I might not have enough!”."
9372,"I did not even have to ask, they offered and that made it feel more comfortable for me."
9373,A sándwich.
9374,no.
9375,A great variety of soft drinks were offered !.
9376,There were no vegetarian options even though I had it selected on my profile.
9377,Disappointed to have no choice of food considering I was towards the front in Premium Plus.
9378,Please have more than the chicken with orzo or impossible meatballs. I have had the same meal 4 times in the past few weeks. Need variety. Especially when the chicken gets over warmed and tough.
9379,"I just think there should maybe be some potato chips, protein shake/bar, nutrigrain bar, Greek yogurt, maybe a a fruit cup. Just more variety if possible. The flights are already expensive so any additional treats or perks would make a customer more satisfied overall."
9380,"The main meal was excellent. The snack was terrible -- a greasy bacon cheeseburger on a soggy bun, with nearly frozen and tasteless fruit."
9381,there was no hot chocolate.
9382,I do not like the requirement of leaving my credit card number on the United website. I limit the locations that information is on the web and this is not high enough on that list for me to do so.
9383,The cookies were nice.
9384,More waffles please.
9385,There were no snack boxes on the plane.
9386,No.
9387,On domestic flight earlier on united airlines we use to get meal.
9388,"You used to offer a diet lemon/lime drink of the category of diet Sprite. diet 7-Up, but now the only diet sodas you offer are diet Coke. Why not carry a few other diet choices?."
9389,Chicken was very spicy. bread was cold.
9390,Also got a hot sandwich about an hour before landing.
9391,no.
9392,So happy to see consistent vegetarian options. Please keep it up. And please consider providing free meals on flights longer than 3 hrs in economy. The loyalty will pay off.
9393,"United should allow business/first passengers to pre-order their meals. If one can, I do not know how."
9394,No.
9395,"The main meal came with a side salad containing three types of dried grapes. I found this side dish to be extremely sweet;. almost dessert-like. If besides the main course the airline is also offering dessert, the entire full course would be extremely high in sugar. I wish my concerns could be considered a positive critic rather than a complain."
9396,We were at back of plane on short flight so last to be served. Not a big deal.
9397,There were no snacks offered during the flight.
9398,No.
9399,The food can have a better choice.
9400,More choices would be nice.
9401,No. Everything was fine.
9402,"Yes, I am a person with a Gluten sensitivity. Please offer at least one Gluten free snack."
9403,"The dinner roll was hard and tough. It should not have been re-heated so much, or even not at all."
9404,There was one attendant who was very efficient for all of us.
9405,In some cases apparently the drinks like Apple juice. we are not available. Blamed on supply issues of course.
9406,No.
9407,I guess that snacks are only for first class or for purchase. I will know for next time to be sure to pack a snack.
9408,You need some app to buy things. Please take credit cards.
9409,not many options.
9410,Impossible meatballs were excellent. Dessert was delicious. Beverages in first class were well done.
9411,Would like to be able to get food.
9412,Dr Pepper.
9413,No.
9414,Only water was offered on our flight from Portland to San Francisco. Disappointed we did not have more beverage options seeing how the flight was almost 2 hours long.
9415,Strawberry ice cream had artificial taste. Orange juice flavor mediocre.
9416,"No veggi option for breakfast, eggs contaminated with meat."
9417,Salad with evening meal was far too spicy (from someone who likes spicy food) Only one very sweet lemon water ice offered Prefer plain rather than mint yoghurt for breakfast.
9418,Ginger beer.
9419,tapas box needs better pita chips. the provide chips are always crumbled and greasy.
9420,"My flight attendant missed my drink order 2x and in the end never received the drink I requested. At that point, we were getting ready to land and it did not matter."
9421,Mo.
9422,"without a smartphone, not much to eat. we packed our own food. your email with food options to buy before our flight did not arrive in our inbox until after we left for our trip to NY."
9423,Offering coffee or tea would also be great.
